Parﬁt's Escape (Filk)
To the tune of "Escape" (The Piña Colada Song), with apologies to Rupert Holmes.
I was lost in the desert, hopelessly dying of thirst
And I thought to myself, this can't get any worse
I heard the roar of an engine, surely it was my hearse
But then a tall shadow cooled me, it spoke and I heard
"If you like living not dying, I got an oﬀer for you
If you give me your money, I'll give you water and food
I'll take you away to salvation, I'll get you out of this scrape
So just promise you'll pay me, to make Parﬁt's escape"
I hadn't solved decision theory, boy I sure wish that I had
'Cause my savior was Omega, and if I lied I'd be had
But CDT said don't pay, just take the ride for free
And though it seemed kind of foolish, I went ahead and agreed
"Yes, I like living not dying, so I'll make your oﬀer good
When we get back to town, I've got money for you
I've got to get out of this desert now, I'm so tired of this place
Yes I two box on Newcomb, and I take Parﬁt's escape"
Omega dragged me to the car, put a canteen to my lips
We drove into the sunset, I felt nothing but bliss
I caught a glimpse of his face, and to my wondering eyes
My driver wasn't Omega, but Singer in disguise
"You don't owe me any money, you're the life I can save
And you should know I would have helped you, if you had lied to my face
I really hope you've learned a lesson though, about the perils of this place
Decision problems are dangerous, it's moral luck you escaped"
I said "Oh thank you Mr. Singer, let me buy you a drink
At a bar called O'Malley's, they make their Coladas pink
'Cause I'm eternally grateful, for all that you've done
Now let's get out of this desert, and be done with this song"

Big Yellow Tractor (Filk)
To the tune of "Big Yellow Taxi", with apologies to Joni Mitchell
we'll pave paradise and put up a parking lot
if that's what it takes to make all the wild suﬀering stop
the pain it only grows and grows
until we boil it up in our pot
we'll pave paradise and put up a parking lot
we'll take all the creatures and put 'em in a simulation
where there's no pain or death or starvation
oh! the pain it only grows and grows
until we boil it up in our pot
we'll pave paradise and put up a parking lot
hey all you people put away decision theory
i don't care about max utils if we can't end suﬀering, please!
the pain it only grows and grows
until we boil it up in our pot
we'll pave paradise and put up a parking lot
late last night I heard 'bout a brand new plan
a big yellow tractor's gonna clear away all the land
oh! the pain it only grows and grows
until we boil it up in our pot
we'll pave paradise and put up a parking lot

Bayesiance (Filk)
To the tune of "Elegance" from Hello Dolly!, with apologies to Jerry Herman
Yes, Less Wrong
It's really us
Bayesians and we're signing songs
Here to speak of priors, what they are
Bayes' Law, math, and the posterior
What a knack
There is to it
Acting like a rational agent
We are Bayesians
If you ain't a Bayesian
You will always risk a Dutch Book write oﬀ
All who are
Well-read agree
Thomas Bayes
Resplendently
Showed the way to conserve evidence
So you never need to lose one pence
Could we be
Misleading you?
Aumann begs to disagree with you
We are Bayesians
If you ain't a Bayesian
You will always risk a Dutch Book write oﬀ
[musical interlude]
Kelly bet?
We always do
Cromwell, yes?
We got tattoos
Some think only frequency should count
We know the unknown is paramount
Von Neumann
Bows down to us
Morgenstern he saves a place for us
[bridge]
We've are Bayesians
We were born with Bayesiance
Maybe we should be like Fisher
And demand more evidence
And we'll never make our minds up

Unless passing a t-test
But not every distribution
Rises to normality
So we need subjective inference
Which inevitably, means
[coda]
We are Bayesians
We got built in Bayesiance
And with Bayesiance...Bayesiance...
Bayesiance...Bayesiance...Bayesiance
We avoid write oﬀs!

Oh No My AI (Filk)
To the tune of "Because I Got High" with apologies to Afroman.
I was gonna save the world
when I built AI
I was gonna make everyone's life great
with my new AI
But I built it unaligned, I don't know why (hey hey)
oh no my AI
oh no my AI
oh no my AI
I made a really nice box
for my AI
I gave it a really good lock
to hold my AI
But it talked its way outside, I'm gonna cry (yeah yeah)
oh no my AI
oh no my AI
oh no my AI
I made my AI smart 
smarter than I
So we could do really cool stuﬀ
all thanks to AI
But it outsmarted me, and now we'll die (oh no)
oh no my AI
oh no my AI
oh no my AI
I wish I'd made it better
a Friendly AI
I shoulda listened to Yudkowsky
when I built AI
But instead we're paperclips, and I know why (say why)
because my AI
is unaligned
oh no my AI
This song is very much amenable to additional verses, so I hope folks have fun writing
additional ones in the comments!

MacArthur BART (Filk)
To the tune of "MacArthur Park" with apologies to Jimmy Webb.
BART was never waiting for us, dear
We ran to catch the train
But we missed it, our last chance
MacArthur BART is frightening in the dark
All the lights they ﬂicker on and oﬀ
Someone left their backpack on the train
I don't think that I should take it
Might be full or drugs or makeup
Better leave it for someone else to ﬁnd
Oh, no
I can still remember better days
The trains ran on time
Never missed a connection
The tracks, like gleaming rails to better lands
Our destinations only a few short stops away
MacArthur BART is frightening in the dark
Hey I think that guy just ﬂipped me oﬀ
He looks like he's lived through better days
And he might be a little dangerous
Might try to take our stuﬀ and hang us
Better leave him and look the other way
Oh, no
MacArthur's BART is melting in the dark
I think my acid ﬁnally hit
Can you see that time is stopping too?
Hey its really not so scary
It's actually ordinary
It's just a matter of your point of view
Oh, no, oh
