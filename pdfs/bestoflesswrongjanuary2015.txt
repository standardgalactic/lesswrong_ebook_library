CFAR fundraiser far from ﬁlled; 4 days
remaining
We're 4 days from the end of our matching fundraiser, and still only about 1/3rd of the
way to our target (and to the point where pledged funds would cease being matched).
If you'd like to support the growth of rationality in the world, do please consider
donating, or asking me about any questions/etc. you may have.  I'd love to talk.  I
suspect funds donated to CFAR between now and Jan 31 are quite high-impact.
As a random bonus, I promise that if we meet the $120k matching challenge, I'll post
at least two posts with some never-before-shared (on here) rationality techniques that
we've been playing with around CFAR.

The Importance of Sidekicks
[Reposted from my personal blog.]
Mindspace is wide and deep. "People are diﬀerent" is a truism, but even knowing this,
it's still easy to underestimate.
I spent much of my initial engagement with the rationality community feeling weird
and diﬀerent. I appreciated the principle and project of rationality as things that were
deeply important to me; I was pretty pro-self improvement, and kept tsuyoku naritai
as my motto for several years. But the rationality community, the people who shared
this interest of mine, often seemed baﬄed by my values and desires. I wasn't
ambitious, and had a hard time wanting to be. I had a hard time wanting to be
anything other than a nurse.
It wasn't until this August that I convinced myself that this wasn't a failure in my
rationality, but rather a diﬀerence in my basic drives. It's around then, in the
aftermath of the 2014 CFAR alumni reunion, that I wrote the following post.
I don't believe in life-changing insights (that happen to me), but I think I've had
one-it's been two weeks and I'm still thinking about it, thus it seems fairly safe to
say I did.
At a CFAR Monday test session, Anna was talking about the idea of having an
"aura of destiny"-it's hard to fully convey what she meant and I'm not sure I get it
fully, but something like seeing yourself as you'll be in 25 years once you've
saved the world and accomplished a ton of awesome things. She added that your
aura of destiny had to be in line with your sense of personal aesthetic, to feel
"you."
I mentioned to Kenzi that I felt stuck on this because I was pretty sure that the
combination of ambition and being the locus of control that "aura of destiny"
conveyed to me was against my sense of personal aesthetic.
Kenzi said, approximately [I don't remember her exact words]: "What if your aura
of destiny didn't have to be those things? What if you could be like...Samwise,
from Lord of the Rings? You're competent, but most importantly, you're *loyal* to
Frodo. You're the reason that the hero succeeds."
I guess this isn't true for most people-Kenzi said she didn't want to keep thinking
of other characters who were like this because she would get so insulted if
someone kept comparing her to people's sidekicks-but it feels like now I know
what I am.
So. I'm Samwise. If you earn my loyalty, by convincing me that what you're
working on is valuable and that you're the person who should be doing it, I'll stick
by you whatever it takes, and I'll *make sure* you succeed. I don't have a Frodo
right now. But I'm looking for one.
It then turned out that quite a lot of other people recognized this, so I shifted from
"this is a weird thing about me" to "this is one basic personality type, out of many."
Notably, Brienne wrote the following comment:

Sidekick" doesn't *quite* ﬁt my aesthetic, but it's extremely close, and I feel it in
certain moods. Most of the time, I think of myself more as what TV tropes would
call a "dragon". Like the Witch-king of Angmar, if we're sticking of LOTR. Or
Bellatrix Black. Or Darth Vader. (It's not my fault people aren't willing to give the
good guys dragons in literature.)
For me, ﬁnding someone who shared my values, who was smart and rational
enough for me to trust him, and who was in a much better position to actually
accomplish what I most cared about than I imagined myself ever being, was the
best thing that could have happened to me.
She also gave me what's maybe one of the best and most moving compliments I've
ever received.
In Australia, something about the way you interacted with people suggested to me
that you help people in a completely free way, joyfully, because it fulﬁlls you to
serve those you care about, and not because you want something from them... I
was able to relax around you, and ask for your support when I needed it while I
worked on my classes. It was really lovely... The other surprising thing was that
you seemed to act that way with everyone. You weren't "on" all the time, but
when you were, everybody around you got the beneﬁt. I'd never recognized in
anyone I'd met a more diﬀuse service impulse, like the whole human race might
be your master. So I suddenly felt like I understood nurses and other people in
similar service roles for the ﬁrst time.
Sarah Constantin, who according to a mutual friend is one of the most loyal people
who exists, chimed in with some nuance to the Frodo/Samwise dynamic: "Sam isn't
blindly loyal to Frodo. He makes sure the mission succeeds even when Frodo is fucking
it up. He stands up to Frodo. And that's important too."
Kate Donovan, who also seems to share this basic psychological makeup, added "I
have a strong preference for making the lives of the lead heroes better, and very little
interest in ever being one."
Meanwhile, there were doubts from others who didn't feel this way. The "we need
heroes, the world needs heroes" narrative is especially strong in the rationalist
community. And typical mind fallacy abounds. It seems easy to assume that if
someone wants to be a support character, it's because they're insecure-that really, if
they believed in themselves, they would aim for protagonist.
I don't think this is true. As Kenzi pointed out: "The other thing I felt like was important
about Samwise is that his self-eﬃcacy around his particular mission wasn't a
detriment to his aura of destiny - he did have insecurities around his ability to do this
thing - to stand by Frodo - but even if he'd somehow not had them, he still would
have been Samwise - like that kind of self-eﬃcacy would have made his essence
*more* distilled, not less."
Brienne added: "Becoming the hero would be a personal tragedy, even though it
would be a triumph for the world if it happened because I surpassed him, or
discovered he was fundamentally wrong."
Why write this post?

Usually, "this is a true and interesting thing about humans" is enough of a reason for
me to write something. But I've got a lot of other reasons, this time.
I suspect that the rationality community, with its "hero" focus, drives away many
people who are like me in this sense. I've thought about walking away from it, for
basically that reason. I could stay in Ottawa and be a nurse for forty years; it would
fulﬁl all my most basic emotional needs, and no one would try to change me. Because
oh boy, have people tried to do that. It's really hard to be someone who just wants to
please others, and to be told, basically, that you're not good enough-and that you
owe it to the world to turn yourself ambitious, strategic, Slytherin.
Firstly, this is mean regardless. Secondly, it's not true.
Samwise was important. So was Frodo, of course. But Frodo needed Samwise. Heroes
need sidekicks. They can function without them, but function a lot better with them.
Maybe it's true that there aren't enough heroes trying to save the world. But there
sure as hell aren't enough sidekicks trying to help them. And there especially aren't
enough talented, competent, awesome sidekicks.
If you're reading this post, and it resonates with you... Especially if you're someone
who has felt unappreciated and alienated for being diﬀerent... I have something to tell
you. You count. You. Fucking. Count. You're needed, even if the heroes don't realize it
yet. (Seriously, heroes, you should be more strategic about looking for awesome
sidekicks. AFAIK only Nick Bostrom is doing it.) This community could use more of you.
Pretty much every community could use more of you.
I'd like, someday, to live in a culture that doesn't shame this way of being. As Brienne
points out, "Society likes *selﬂess* people, who help everybody equally, sure. It's
socially acceptable to be a nurse, for example. Complete loyalty and devotion to "the
hero", though, makes people think of brainwashing, and I'm not sure what else exactly
but bad things." (And not all subsets of society even accept nursing as a Valid Life
Choice.) I'd like to live in a world where an aspiring Samwise can ﬁnd role models;
where he sees awesome, successful people and can say, "yes, I want to grow up to be
that."
Maybe I can't have that world right away. But at least I know what I'm reaching for. I
have a name for it. And I have a Frodo-Ruby and I are going to be working together
from here on out. I have a reason not to walk away.

2014 Survey Results
Thanks to everyone who took the 2014 Less Wrong Census/Survey. Extra thanks to Ozy, who did a lot of the number
crunching work.
This year's results are below. Some of them may make more sense in the context of the original survey questions, which can
be seen here. Please do not try to take the survey as it is over and your results will not be counted.
I. Population
There were 1503 respondents over 27 days. The last survey got 1636 people over 40 days. The last four full days of the
survey saw nineteen, six, and four responses, for an average of about ten. If we assume the next thirteen days had also
gotten an average of ten responses - which is generous, since responses tend to trail oﬀ with time - then we would have
gotten about as many people as the last survey. There is no good evidence here of a decline in population, although it is
perhaps compatible with a very small decline.

In addition to the Left/Right factor we had last year, this data seems to me to have an Agrees with the Sequences Factor--
the same people tend to believe in many-worlds, cryo, atheism, simulationism, MIRI's mission and eﬀectiveness, anti-
agathics, etc. Weirdly, belief in global catastrophic risk is negatively correlated with most of the Agrees with Sequences
things. Someone who actually knows how to do statistics should run a factor analysis on this data.
IX. Digit Ratios
After sanitizing the digit ratio numbers, the following correlations came up:
Digit ratio R hand was correlated with masculinity at a level of -0.180 p < 0.01
Digit ratio L hand was correlated with masculinity at a level of -0.181 p < 0.01
Digit ratio R hand was slightly correlated with femininity at a level of +0.116 p < 0.05
Holy #@!$ the feminism thing ACTUALLY HELD UP. There is a 0.144 correlation between right-handed digit ratio and
feminism, p < 0.01. And an 0.112 correlation between left-handed digit ratio and feminism, p < 0.05.
The only other political position that correlates with digit ratio is immigration. There is a 0.138 correlation between left-
handed digit ratio and believe in open borders p < 0.01, and an 0.111 correlation between right-handed digit ratio and belief
in open borders, p < 0.05.
No digit correlation with abortion, taxes, minimum wage, social justice, human biodiversity, basic income, or great
stagnation.
Okay, need to rule out that this is all confounded by gender. I ran a few analyses on men and women separately.
On men alone, the connection to masculinity holds up. Restricting sample size to men, left-handed digit ratio corresponds to
masculinity with at -0.157, p < 0.01. Left handed at -0.134, p < 0.05. Right-handed correlates with femininity at 0.120, p <
0.05. The feminism correlation holds up. Restricting sample size to men, right-handed digit ratio correlates with feminism at
a level of 0.149, p < 0.01. Left handed just barely fails to correlate. Both right and left correlate with immigration at 0.135, p
< 0.05.
On women alone, the Bem masculinity correlation is the highest correlation we're going to get in this entire study. Right
hand is -0.433, p < 0.01. Left hand is -0.299, p < 0.05. Femininity trends toward signiﬁcance but doesn't get there. The
feminism correlation trends toward signiﬁcance but doesn't get there. In general there was too small a sample size of
women to pick up anything but the most whopping eﬀects.
Since digit ratio is related to testosterone and testosterone sometimes aﬀects risk-taking, I wondered if it would correlate
with any of the calibration answers. I selected people who had answered Calibration Question 5 incorrectly and ran an
analysis to see if digit ratio was correlated with tendency to be more conﬁdent in the incorrect answer. No eﬀect was found.
Other things that didn't correlate with digit ratio: IQ, SAT, number of current partners, tendency to work in mathematical
professions.
...I still can't believe this actually worked. The ﬁnger-length/feminism connection ACTUALLY WORKED. What a world. What a
world. Someone may want to double-check these results before I get too excited.
X. Calibration
There were ten calibration questions on this year's survey. Along with answers, they were:
1. What is the largest bone in the body? Femur
2. What state was President Obama born in? Hawaii
3. Oﬀ the coast of what country was the battle of Trafalgar fought? Spain
4. What Norse God was called the All-Father? Odin
5. Who won the 1936 Nobel Prize for his work in quantum physics? Heisenberg
6. Which planet has the highest density? Earth
7. Which Bible character was married to Rachel and Leah? Jacob
8. What organelle is called "the powerhouse of the cell"? Mitochondria
9. What country has the fourth-highest population? Indonesia
10. What is the best-selling computer game? Minecraft
I ran calibration scores for everybody based on how well they did on the ten calibration questions. These failed to correlate
with IQ, SAT, LW karma, or any of the things you might expect to be measures of either intelligence or previous training in
calibration; they didn't diﬀer by gender, correlates of community membership, or any mental illness [deleted section about
correlating with MWI and MIRI, this was an artifact].

Your answers looked like this:
The red line represents perfect calibration. Where answers dip below the line, it means you were overconﬁdent; when they
go above, it means you were underconﬁdent.
It looks to me like everyone was horrendously underconﬁdent on all the easy questions, and horrendously overconﬁdent on
all the hard questions. To give an example of how horrendous, people who were 50% sure of their answers to question 10
got it right only 13% of the time; people who were 100% sure only got it right 44% of the time. Obviously those numbers
should be 50% and 100% respectively.
This builds upon results from previous surveys in which your calibration was also horrible. This is not a human universal -
people who put even a small amount of training into calibration can become very well calibrated very quickly. This is a sign
that most Less Wrongers continue to neglect the very basics of rationality and are incapable of judging how much evidence
they have on a given issue. Veterans of the site do no better than newbies on this measure.
XI. Wrapping Up
To show my appreciation for everyone completing this survey, including the arduous digit ratio measurements, I have
randomly chosen a person to receive a $30 monetary prize. That person is...the person using the public key "The World Is
Quiet Here". If that person tells me their private key, I will give them $30.

I have removed 73 people who wished to remain private, deleted the Private Keys, and sanitized a very small amount of
data. Aside from that, here are the raw survey results for your viewing and analyzing pleasure:

Bill Gates: problem of strong AI with
conﬂicting goals "very worthy of
study and time"
Steven Levy: Let me ask an unrelated question about the raging debate over
whether artiﬁcial intelligence poses a threat to society, or even the survival of
humanity. Where do you stand?
Bill Gates: I think it's deﬁnitely important to worry about. There are two AI threats
that are worth distinguishing. One is that AI does enough labor substitution fast
enough to change work policies, or [aﬀect] the creation of new jobs that humans
are uniquely adapted to — the jobs that give you a sense of purpose and worth.
We haven't run into that yet. I don't think it's a dramatic problem in the next ten
years but if you take the next 20 to 30 it could be. Then there's the longer-term
problem of so-called strong AI, where it controls resources, so its goals are
somehow conﬂicting with the goals of human systems. Both of those things are
very worthy of study and time. I am certainly not in the camp that believes we
ought to stop things or slow things down because of that. But you can deﬁnitely
put me more in the Elon Musk, Bill Joy camp than, let's say, the Google camp on
that one.

Behavior: The Control of Perception
This is the second of three posts dealing with control
theory and Behavior: The Control of Perception by
William Powers. The previous post gave an
introduction to control theory, in the hopes that a
shared language will help communicate the models
the book is discussing. This post discusses the model
introduced in the book. The next post will provide
commentary on the model and what I see as its
implications, for both LW and AI.
B:CP was published in 1973 by William Powers, who
was a controls engineer before he turned his attention
to psychology. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he thought that
the best lens for psychology was the one he had been
trained in, and several sections of the book contrast
his approach with the behaviorist approach. This
debate is before my time, and so I ﬁnd it mostly
uninteresting, and will only bring it up when I think the
contrast clariﬁes the diﬀerence in methodology,
focusing instead on the meat of his model.
The ﬁrst ﬁve chapters of B:CP introduce analog computers and feedback loops, and
make the claim that it's better to model the nervous system as an analog computer,
with continuous neural currents (with the strength of the current determined by the
rate of the underlying impulses and number of branches, as each impulse has the
same strength) rather than as a digital computer. On the macroscale, this seems
unobjectionable, and while it makes the model clearer I'm not sure that it's necessary.
He also steps through how to physically instantiate a number of useful mathematical
functions with a handful of neurons; in general, I'll ignore that detailed treatment but
you should trust that the book makes a much more detailed argument for the physical
plausibility of this model than I do here.
The sixth chapter discusses the idea of hierarchical modeling. We saw a bit of that in
the last post, with the example of a satellite that had two control systems, one which
used sense data of the thruster impulses and the rotation to determine the inertia
model, and the other which uses the rotation and the inertia model to determine the
thruster impulses. The key point here is that the models are inherently local, and thus
can be separated into units. The ﬁrst model doesn't have to know that there's another
feedback loop; it just puts the sense data it receives through a formula, and uses
another formula to update its memory, which has the property of reducing the error of
its model. Another way to look at this is that control systems are, in some sense,
agnostic of what they're sensing and what they're doing, and their reference level
comes from the environment similar to any other input. While one might see the two
satellite systems as not being stacked, when one control circuit has no outputs except
to vary the reference levels of other control circuits, it makes sense to see the
reference-setting control circuit as superior in the hierarchical organization of the
system.
There's a key insight hidden there which is probably best to show by example. The
next ﬁve chapters of B:CP step through ﬁve levels in the hierarchy. Imagine this

section as building a model of a human as a robot- there are output devices (muscles
and glands and so on) and input devices (sensory nerve endings) that are connected
to the environment. Powers discusses both output and input, but here I'll just discuss
output for brevity's sake.
Powers calls the ﬁrst level intensity, and it deals directly with those output and input
devices. Consider a muscle; the control loop there might have a reference tension in
the muscle that it acts to maintain, and that tension corresponds to the outside
environment. From the point of view of measured units, the control loops here convert
between some physical quantity and neural current.
Powers calls the second level sensation, and it deals with combinations of ﬁrst level
sensors. As we've put all of the actual muscular eﬀort of the arm and hand into the
ﬁrst level, the second level is one level of abstraction up. Powers suggests that the
arm and hand have about 27 independent movements, and each movement
represents some vector in the many-dimensional space of however many ﬁrst order
control loops there are. (Flexing the wrist, for example, might reﬂect an increase of
eﬀort intensity of muscles in the forearm on one side and a decrease of eﬀort intensity
of muscles on the other side.) Note that from this point on, the measured units are all
the same--amperes of neural current--and that means we can combine unlike physical
things because they have some conceptual similarity. This is the level of clustering
where it starts to make sense to talk about a 'wrist,' or at least particular joints in it, or
something like a 'lemonade taste,' which exists as a mental combination of the levels
of sugar and acid in a liquid. The value of a hierarchy also starts to become clear-
when we want to ﬂex the wrist, we don't have to calculate what command to send to
each individual muscle- we simply set a new reference level for the wrist-controller,
and it adjusts the reference levels for many diﬀerent muscle-controllers.
Powers calls the third level conﬁguration, and it deals with combinations of second
level loops. The example here would be the position of the joints in the arm or hand,
such as positioning the hand to perform the Vulcan salute. 
Powers calls the fourth level transition, and it deals with combinations of third level
loops, as well as integration or diﬀerentiation of them. A third order control loop might
put the mouth and vocal cords where they need to be to make a particular note, and a
fourth order control loop could vary the note that third order control loop is trying to
hit in order to create a pitch that rises at a certain rate.
Powers calls the ﬁfth level sequence, and it deals with combinations and patterns of
the fourth level loops. Here we see patterns of behavior- a higher level can direct a
loop at this level to 'walk' to a particular place, and then the orders go down until
muscles contract at the lowest level.
The key insight is that we can, whenever we identify a layer, see that layer as part of
the environment of the hierarchy above that layer. At the 0th layer, we have the
universe- at the 1st layer, we have a body, at the 2nd layer, we have a brain (and
maybe a spine and other bits of the nervous system). Moving up layers in the
organization is like peeling an onion; we consider smaller and smaller portions of the
physical brain and consider more and more abstract concepts.
I'm not a neuroscientist, but I believe that until this point Powers's account would
attract little controversy. The actual organization structure of the body is not as
cleanly pyramidal as this brief summary makes it sound, but Powers acknowledges as
much and the view remains broadly accurate and useful. There's ample neurological

evidence to support that there are parts of the brain that do the particular functions
we would expect the various orders of control loops to do, and the interested reader
should take a look at the book.
Where Powers's argument becomes more novel, speculative, and contentious is the
that the levels keep going up, with the same basic architecture. Instead of an layered
onion body wrapped around an opaque homunculus mind, it's an onion all the way to
the center- which Powers speculates ends at around the 9th level. (More recent work, I
believe, estimates closer to 11 levels.) The hierarchy isn't necessarily neat, with
clearly identiﬁable levels, but there is some sort of hierarchical block diagram that
stretches from terminal goals to the environment. He identiﬁes the levels as
relationships, algorithms (which he calls program control), principles, and system
concepts. As the abstractness of the concepts would suggest, their treatment is more
vague and he manages to combine them all into a single chapter, with very little of
the empirical justiﬁcation that ﬁlled earlier chapters.
This seems inherently plausible to me:
1. It's parsimonious to use the same approach to signal processing everywhere,
and it seems easier to just add on another layer of signal processing (which
allows more than a linear increase in potential complexity of organism behavior)
than to create an entirely new kind of brain structure.
2. Deep learning and similar approaches in machine learning can ﬁt comparable
architecture in an unsupervised fashion. My understanding of the crossover
between machine learning and neuroscience is that we understand machine
vision the best, and many good algorithms line up with what we see in human
brains--pixels get aggregated to make edges which get aggregated to make
shapes, and so on up the line. So we see the neural hierarchies this model
predicts, but this isn't too much of a surprise because hierarchies are the easiest
structures to detect and interpret.
What is meant by "terminal goals"? Well, control systems have to get their reference
from somewhere, and the structure of the brain can't be "turtles all the way up."
Eventually there should be a measured variable, like "hunger," which is compared to
some reference, and any diﬀerence between the variable and the reference leads to
action targeted at reducing the diﬀerence.
That reference could be genetic/instinctual, or determined by early experience, or
modiﬁed by chemicals, or so on, but the point is that it isn't the feedback of a
neural control loop above it. Chapter 14 discusses learning as the reorganization of
the control system, and the processes used there seem potentially suﬃcient to
explain where the reference levels and the terminal goals come from.

Indeed, the entire remainder of the book, discussing emotion, conﬂict, and so on,
ﬂeshes out this perspective in a full way that I could only begin to touch on here, so I
will simply recommend reading the book if you're interested in his model. Here's a
sample on conﬂict:
Conﬂict is an encounter between two control systems, an encounter of a speciﬁc
kind. In eﬀect, the two control systems attempt to control the same quantity, but
with respect to two diﬀerent reference levels. For one system to correct an error,
the other system must experience error. There is no way for both systems to
experience zero error at the same time. Therefore the outputs of the system must
act on the shared controlled quantity in opposite directions.
If both systems are reasonably sensitive to error, and the two reference levels are
far apart, there will be a range of values of the controlled quantity (between the
reference levels) throughout which each system will contain an error signal so
large that the output of each system will be solidly at its maximum. These two
outputs, if about equal, will cancel, leaving essentially no net output to aﬀect the
controlled quantity. Certainly the net output cannot change as the "controlled"
quantity changes in this region between the reference levels, since both outputs
remain at maximum.
This means there is a range of values over which the controlled quantity cannot
be protected against disturbance any more. Any moderate disturbance will
change the controlled quantity, and this will change the perceptual signals in the
two control systems. As long as neither reference level is closely approached,
there will be no reaction to these changes on the part of the conﬂicted systems.
When a disturbance forces the controlled quantity close enough to either
reference level, however, there will be a reaction. The control system experiencing
lessened error will relax, unbalancing the net output in the direction of the other
reference level. As a result, the conﬂicted pair of systems will act like a single
system having a "virtual reference level," between the two actual ones. A large
dead zone will exist around the virtual reference level, within which there is little
or no control.
In terms of real behavior, this model of conﬂict seems to have the right properties.
Consider a person who has two goals: one to be a nice guy, and the other to be a
strong, self-suﬃcient person. If he perceives these two conditions in the "right"
way (for conﬂict) he may ﬁnd himself wanting to be deferential and pleasant, and
at the same time wanting to speak up ﬁrmly for his rights. As a result, he does
neither. He drifts in a state between, his attitude ﬂuctuating with every change in
external circumstances, undirected. When cajoled and coaxed enough he may ﬁnd
himself beginning to warm up, smile, and think of a pleasant remark, but
immediately he realizes that he is being manipulated and resentfully breaks oﬀ
communication or utters a cutting remark. On the other hand if circumstances
lead him to begin defending himself against unfair treatment, his ﬁrst strong
words ﬁll him with remorse and he blunts his defense with an apologetic giggle.
He can react only when pushed to one extreme or the other, and his reaction
takes him back to the uncontrolled middle ground.
So what was that about behaviorism?

According to Powers, most behaviorists thought in terms of 'stimulus->response,'
where you could model a creature as a lookup table that would respond in a particular
way to a particular stimulus. This has some obvious problems--how do we cluster
stimuli? Someone saying "I love you" means very diﬀerent things depending on the
context. If the creature has a goal that depends on a relationship between entities,
like wanting there to not be an unblocked line between their eyes and the sun, then
you need to know the position of the sun to best model their response to any stimulus.
Otherwise, if you just record what happens when you move a shade to the left, you'll
notice that sometimes they move left and sometimes they move right. (Consider the
diﬀerence between 1-place functions and 2-place functions.)
Powers discusses a particular experiment of neural stimulation in cats where the
researchers couldn't easily interpret what some neurons were doing in behaviorist
terms, because the cat would inconsistently move one way or another, but the control
theory view parsimoniously explained the neurons as being higher order, which meant
that the original position had to be taken into account to determine what the error was
when the reference was adjusted by electrical stimulation, as it's the error that
determines the response rather than just the reference.
If we want to have a lookup table in which the entire life history of the creature is the
input, then ﬁguring out what this table looks like is basically impossible. We want
something that's complex enough to encode realistic behavior without being complex
enough to encode unrealistic behavior--that is, we want the structure of our model to
match the structure of the actual brain and behavior, and it looks like the control
theory view is a strong candidate.
Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in this ﬁeld, so I can't tell you what the state of the
academic discussion looks like now. I get the impression that a number of
psychologists have at least partly bought into the BCP paradigm (called Perceptual
Control Theory) and have been working on their interests for decades, but it doesn't
seem to have swept the ﬁeld. As a general comment, controversies like this are often
resolved by synthesis rather than the complete victory of one side over the other. If
modern psychologists have learned a bit of the hierarchical control systems viewpoint
and avoided the worst silliness of the past, then the historic criticisms are no longer
appropriate and most of the low-hanging fruit from adopting this view haven already
been picked. 
Next: a comparison with utility, discussion of previous discussion on LW, and some
thoughts on how thinking about control systems can impact thinking about AI.

Elon Musk donates $10M to the
Future of Life Institute to keep AI
beneﬁcial
We are delighted to report that technology inventor Elon Musk, creator of Tesla
and SpaceX, has decided to donate $10M to the Future of Life Institute to run a
global research program aimed at keeping AI beneﬁcial to humanity. 
There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that
its impact on society is likely to increase. A long list of leading AI-researchers have
signed an open letter calling for research aimed at ensuring that AI systems are
robust and beneﬁcial, doing what we want them to do. Musk's donation aims to
support precisely this type of research: "Here are all these leading AI researchers
saying that AI safety is important", says Elon Musk. "I agree with them, so I'm
today committing $10M to support research aimed at keeping AI beneﬁcial for
humanity." 
[...] The $10M program will be administered by the Future of Life Institute, a non-
proﬁt organization whose scientiﬁc advisory board includes AI-researchers Stuart
Russell and Francesca Rossi. [...]
The research supported by the program will be carried out around the globe via
an open grants competition, through an application portal at http://futureoﬂife.org
that will open by Thursday January 22. The plan is to award the majority of the
grant funds to AI researchers, and the remainder to AI-related research involving
other ﬁelds such as economics, law, ethics and policy  (a detailed list of examples
can be found here [PDF]). "Anybody can send in a grant proposal, and the best
ideas will win regardless of whether they come from academia, industry or
elsewhere", says FLI co-founder Viktoriya Krakovna. 
[...] Along with research grants, the program will also include meetings and
outreach programs aimed at bringing together academic AI researchers, industry
AI developers and other key constituents to continue exploring how to maximize
the societal beneﬁts of AI; one such meeting was held in Puerto Rico last week
with many of the open-letter signatories.

Immortality: A Practical Guide
Immortality: A Practical Guide
Introduction
This article is about how to increase one's own chances of living forever or, failing that, living for a long time. To be clear, this guide 
defines death as the long-term loss of one's consciousness and defines immortality as never-ending life. For those who would like 
less lengthy information on decreasing one's risk of death, I recommend reading the sections "Can we become immortal," "Should 
we try to become immortal," and "Cryonics," in this guide, along with the article Lifestyle Interventions to Increase Longevity.
This article does not discuss how to treat specific disease you may have. It is not intended as a substitute for the medical advice of 
physicians. You should consult a physician with respect to any symptoms that may require diagnosis or medical attention. 
When reading about the effect sizes in scientific studies, keep in mind that many scientific studies report false-positives and are 
biased,101 though I have tried to minimize this by maximizing the quality of the studies used. Meta-analyses and scientific reviews 
seem to typically be of higher quality than other study types, but are still subject to biases.114
Corrections, criticisms, and suggestions for new topics are greatly appreciated. I've tried to write this article tersely, so feedback on 
doing so would be especially appreciated. Apologies if the article's font type, size and color isn't standard on Less Wrong; I made it in 
google docs without being aware of Less Wrong's standard and it would take too much work changing the style of the entire article.

Can we become immortal? 
In order to potentially live forever, one never needs to make it impossible to die; one instead just needs to have one's life expectancy 
increase faster than time passes, a concept known as the longevity escape velocity.61 For example, if one had a 10% chance of 
dying in their first century of life, but their chance of death decreased by 90% at the end of each century, then one's chance of ever 
dying would be be 0.1 + 0.12 + 0.13... = 0.11... = 11.11...%. When applied to risk of death from aging, this akin to one's remaining life 
expectancy after jumping off a cliff while being affected by gravity and jet propulsion, with gravity being akin to aging and jet 
propulsion being akin to anti-aging (rejuvenation) therapies, as shown below.
The numbers in the above figure denote plausible ages of individuals when the first rejuvenation therapies arrive. A 30% increase in 
healthy lifespan would give the users of first-generation rejuvenation therapies 20 years to benefit from second-generation 
rejuvenation therapies, which could give an additional 30% increase if life span, ad infinitum.61
As for causes of death, many deaths are strongly age-related. The proportion of deaths that are caused by aging in the industrial 
world approaches 90%.53 Thus, I suppose postponing aging would drastically increase life expectancy.
As for efforts against aging, the SENS Research foundation and Science for Life Extension are charitable foundations for trying to 
cure aging.54, 55 Additionally, Calico, a Google-backed company, and AbbVie, a large pharmaceutical company, have each 
committed fund $250 million to cure aging.56
I speculate that one could additionally decrease risk of death by becoming a cyborg, as mechanical bodies seem easier to maintain 
than biological ones, though I've found no articles discussing this.

Similar to becoming a cyborg, another potential method of decreasing one's risk of death is mind uploading, which is, roughly 
speaking, the transfer of most or all of one's mental contents into a computer.62 However, there are some concerns about the 
transfer creating a copy of one's consciousness, rather than being the same consciousness. This issue is made very apparent if the 
mind-uploaded process leaves the original mind intact, making it seem unlikely that one's consciousness was transferred to the new 
body.63 Eliezer Yudkowsky doesn't seem to believe this is an issue, though I haven't found a citation for this.
With regard to consciousness, it seems that most individuals believe that the consciousness in one's body is the "same" 
consciousness as the one that was in one's body in the past and will be in it in the future. However, I know of no evidence for this. If 
one's consciousness isn't the same of the one in one's body in the future, and one defined death as one's consciousness 
permanently ending, then I suppose one can't prevent death for any time at all. Surprisingly, I've found no articles discussing this 
possibility.
Although curing aging, becoming a cyborg, and mind uploading may prevent death from disease, they still seem to leave oneself 
vulnerable to accidents, murder, suicide, and existential catastrophes. I speculate that these problems could be solved by giving an 
artificial superintelligence the ability to take control of one's body in order to prevent such deaths from occurring. Of course, this 
possibility is currently unavailable.
Another potential cause of death is the Sun expanding, which could render Earth uninhabitable in roughly one billion years. Death 
from this could be prevented by colonizing other planets in the solar system, although eventually the sun would render the rest of the 
solar system uninhabitable. After this, one could potentially inhabit other stars; it is expected that stars will remain for roughly 10 
quintillion years, although some theories predict that the universe will be destroyed in a mere 20 billion years. To continue surviving, 
one could potentially go to other universes.64 Additionally, there are ideas for space-time crystals that could process information even 
after heat death (i.e. the "end of the universe"),65 so perhaps one could make oneself composed of the space-time crystals via mind 
uploading or another technique. There could also be other methods of surviving the conventional end of the universe, and life could 
potentially have 10 quintillion years to find them.
Yet another potential cause of death is living in a computer simulation that is ended. The probability of one living in a computer 
simulation actually seems to not be very improbable. Nick Bostrom argues that:
...at least one of the following propositions is true: (1) The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman 
stage is very close to zero; (2) The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is 
very close to zero; (3) The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to 
one.
The argument for this is here.100
If one does die, one could potentially be revived. Cryonics, discussed later in this article, may help in this. Additionally, I suppose one 
could possibly be revived if future intelligences continually create new conscious individuals and eventually create one of them that 
have one's "own" consciousness, though consciousness remains a mystery, so this may not be plausible, and I've found no articles 
discussing this possibility. If the probability of one's consciousness being revived per unit time does not approach or equal zero as 
time approaches infinity, then I suppose one is bound to become conscious again, though this scenario may be unlikely. Again, I've 
found no articles discussing this possibility.
As already discussed, in order to be live forever, one must either be revived after dying or prevent death from the consciousness in 
one's body not being the same as the one that will be in one's body in the future, accidents, aging, the sun dying, the universe dying, 
being in a simulation and having it end, and other, unknown, causes. Keep in mind that adding extra details that aren't guaranteed to 
be true can only make events less probable, and that people often don't account for this.66 A spreadsheet for estimating one's 
chance of living forever is here.
 
Should we try to become immortal?
Before deciding whether one should try to become immortal, I suggest learning about the cognitive biases scope insensitivity, 
hyperbolic discounting, and bias blind spot if you don't know currently know about them. Also, keep in mind that one study found that 
simply informing people of a cognitive bias made them no less likely to fall prey to it. A study also found that people only partially 
adjusted for cognitive biases after being told that informing people of a cognitive bias made them no less likely to fall prey to it.67
Many articles arguing against immortality are found via a quick google search, including this, this, this, and this. This article along 
with its comments discusses counter-arguments to many of these arguments. The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant provides an argument 
for curing aging, which can be extended to be an argument against mortality as a whole. I suggest reading it.
One can also evaluate the utility of immortality via decision theory. Assuming individuals receive a finite amount of utility per unit time 
such that it is never less than some above-zero constant, living forever would give infinitely more utility than living for a finite amount 
of time. Using these assumptions, in order to maximize utility, one should be willing to accept any finite cost to become immortal. 
However, the situation is complicated when one considers the potential of becoming immortal and receiving an infinite positive utility 
unintentionally, in which case one would receive infinite expected utility regardless of if one tried to become immortal. Additionally, if 

one both has the chance of receiving infinitely high and infinitely low utility, one's expected utility would be undefined. Infinite utilities 
are discussed in "Infinite Ethics" by Nick Bostrom.
For those interested in decreasing existential risk, living for a very long time, albeit not necessarily forever, may give one more 
opportunity to do so. This idea can be generalized to many goals one has in life.
On whether one can influence one's chances of becoming immortal, studies have shown that only roughly 20-30% of longevity in 
humans is accounted for by genetic factors.68 There are multiple actions one can to increase one's chances of living forever; these 
are what the rest of this article is about. Keep in mind that you should consider continuing reading this article even if you don't want 
to try to become immortal, as the article provides information on living longer, even if not forever, as well.
 
Relative importance of the different topics
The figure below gives the relative frequencies of preventable causes of death.
1
Some causes of death are excluded from the graph, but are still large causes of death. Most notably, 440,000 deaths in the US, 
roughly one sixth of total deaths in the US are estimated to be from preventable medical errors in hospitals.2 
Risk calculators for cardiovascular disease are here and here. Though they seem very simplistic, they may be worth looking at and 
can probably be completed quickly.
Here are the frequencies of causes of deaths in the US in year 2010 based off of another classification:
Heart disease: 596,577
Cancer: 576,691
Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 142,943
Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 128,932
Accidents (unintentional injuries): 126,438
Alzheimer's disease: 84,974
Diabetes: 73,831
Influenza and Pneumonia: 53,826
Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis: 45,591

Intentional self-harm (suicide): 39,518
113
 
Food
What to eat and drink
Keep in mind that the relationship between health and the consumption of types of substances aren't necessarily linear. I.e. some 
substances are beneficial in small amounts but harmful in large amounts, while others are beneficial in both small and large 
amounts, but consuming large amounts is no more beneficial than consuming small amounts.
 
Recommendations from The Nutrition Source
The Nutrition Source is part of the Harvard School of Public Health.
Its recommendations:
Make ½ of your "plate" consist of a variety of fruits and a variety of vegetables, excluding potatoes, due to potatoes' negative 
effect on blood sugar. The Harvard School of Public Health doesn't seem to specify if this is based on calories or volume. It 
also doesn't explain what it means by plate, but presumably ½ of one's plate means ½ solid food consumed.
Make ¼ of your plate consist of whole grains.
Make ¼ of your plate consist of high-protein foods. 
Limit red meat consumption.
Avoid processed meats.
Consume monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in moderation; they are healthy.
Avoid partially hydrogenated oils, which contain trans fats, which are unhealthy.
Limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day.
Limit juice to one small glass per day.
It is important to eat seafood one or two times per week, particularly fatty (dark meat) fish that are richer in EPA and DHA.
Limit diet drink consumption or consume in moderation. 
Avoid sugary drinks like soda, sports drinks, and energy drinks.3
 
Fat
The bottom line is that saturated fats and especially trans fats are unhealthy, while unsaturated fats are healthy and the types of 
unsaturated fats omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids fats are essential. The proportion of calories from fat in one's diet isn't really 
linked with disease.
Saturated fat is unhealthy. It's generally a good idea to minimize saturated fat consumption. The latest Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans recommends consuming no more than 10% of calories from saturated fat, but the American Heart Association 
recommends consuming no more than 7% of calories from saturated fat. However, don't decrease nut, oil, and fish consumption to 
minimize saturated fat consumption. Foods that contain large amounts of saturated fat include red meat, butter, cheese, and ice 
cream.
Trans fats are especially unhealthy. For every 2% increase of calories from trans-fat, risk of coronary heart disease increases by 
23%. The Federal Institute for Medicine states that there are no known requirements for trans fats for bodily functions, so their 
consumption should be minimized. Partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats, and foods that contain trans fats are often 
processed foods. In the US, products can claim to have zero grams of trans fat if they have no more than 0.5 grams of trans fat. 
Products with no more than 0.5 grams of trans fat that still have non-negligible amounts of trans fat will probably have the ingredients 
"partially hydrogenated vegetable oils" or "vegetable shortening" in their ingredient list.
Unsaturated fats have beneficial effects, including improving cholesterol levels, easing inflammation, and stabilizing heart rhythms. 
The American Heart Association has set 8-10% of calories as a target for polyunsaturated fat consumption, though eating more 
polyunsaturated fat, around 15%of daily calories, in place of saturated fat may further lower heart disease risk. Consuming 
unsaturated fats instead of saturated fat also prevents insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. Monounsaturated fats and 
polyunsaturated fats are types of unsaturated fats.
Omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 fats) are a type of unsaturated fat. There are two main types: Marine omega-3s and alpha-linolenic 
acid (ALA). Omega-3 fatty acids, especially marine omega-3s, are healthy. Though one can make most needed types of fats from 
other fats or substances consumed, omega-3 fat is an essential fat, meaning it is an important type of fat and cannot be made in the 
body, so they must come from food. Most americans don't get enough omega-3 fats.

Marine omega-3s are primarily found in fish, especially fatty (dark mean) fish. A comprehensive review found that eating roughly two 
grams per week of omega-3s from fish, equal to about one or two servings of fatty fish per week, decreased risk of death from heart 
disease by more than one-third. Though fish contain mercury, this is insignificant the positive health effects of their consumption (for 
the consumer, not the fish). However, it does benefit one's health to consult local advisories to determine how much local freshwater 
fish to consume.
 ALA may be an essential nutrient, and increased ALA consumption may be beneficial. ALA is found in vegetable oils, nuts 
(especially walnuts), flax seeds, flaxseed oil, leafy vegetables, and some animal fat, especially those from grass-fed animals. ALA is 
primarily used as energy, but a very small amount of it is converted into marine omega-3s. ALA is the most common omega-3 in 
western diets. 
Most Americans consume much more omega-6 fatty acids (omega-6 fats) than omega-3 fats. Omega-6 fat is an essential nutrient 
and its consumption is healthy. Some sources of it include corn and soybean oils. The Nutrition Sources stated that the theory that 
omega-3 fats are healthier than omega-6 fats isn't supported by evidence. However, in an image from the Nutrition Source, seafood 
omega-6 fats were ranked as healthier than plant omega-6 fats, which were ranked as healthier than monounsaturated fats, although 
such a ranking was to the best of my knowledge never stated in the text.3
 
Carbohydrates
There seems to be two main determinants of carbohydrate sources' effects on health: nutrition content and effect on blood sugar. 
The bottom line is that consuming whole grains and other less processed grains and decreasing refined grain consumption improves 
health. Additionally, moderately low carbohydrate diets can increase heart health as long as protein and fat comes from health 
sources, though the type of carbohydrate at least as important as the amount of carbohydrates in a diet.
Glycemic index and is a measure of how much food increases blood sugar levels. Consuming carbohydrates that cause blood-sugar 
spikes can increase risk of heart disease and diabetes at least as much as consuming too much saturated fat does. Some factors 
that increase the glycemic index of foods include:
Being a refined grain as opposed to a whole grain.
Being finely ground, which is why consuming whole grains in their whole form, such as rice, can be healthier than 
consuming them as bread.
Having less fiber.
Being more ripe, in the case of fruits and vegetables.
Having a lower fat content, as meals with fat are converted more slowly into sugar. 
Vegetables (excluding potatoes), fruits, whole grains, and beans, are healthier than other carbohydrates. Potatoes have a negative 
effect on blood sugar, due to their high glycemic index. Information on glycemic index and the index of various foods is here.
Whole grains also contain essential minerals such as magnesium, selenium, and copper, which may protect against some cancers. 
Refining grains takes away 50% of the grains' B vitamins, 90% of vitamin E, and virtually all fiber. Sugary drinks usually have little 
nutritional value.
Identifying whole grains as food that has at least one gram of fiber for every gram of carbohydrate is a more effective measure of 
healthfulness than identifying a whole grain as the first ingredient, any whole grain as the first ingredient without added sugars in the 
first 3 ingredients, the word "whole" before any grain ingredient, and the whole grain stamp.3
 
Protein
Proteins are broken down to form amino acids, which are needed for health. Though the body can make some amino acids by 
modifying others, some must come from food, which are called essential amino acids. The institute of medicine recommends that 
adults get a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, and sets the range of acceptable protein intake to 
10-35% of calories per day. The Institute of Medicine recommends getting 10-35% of calories from protein each day. The US 
recommended daily allowance for protein is 46 grams per day for women over 18 and 56 grams per day for men over 18. 
Animal products tend to give all essential amino acids, but other sources lack some essential amino acids. Thus, vegetarians need to 
consume a variety of sources of amino acids each day to get all needed types. Fish, chicken, beans, and nuts are healthy protein 
sources.3
 
Fiber
There are two types of fiber: soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. Both have important health benefits, so one should eat a variety of 
foods to get both.94 The best sources of fiber are whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts.3

 
Micronutrients
There are many micronutrients in food; getting enough of them is important. Most healthy individuals can get sufficient micronutrients 
by consuming a wide variety of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and lean meats and fish. However, 
supplementation may be necessary for some. Information about supplements is here.110
Concerning supplementation, potassium, iodine, and lithium supplementation are recommended in the first-place entry in the 
Quantified Health Prize, a contest on determining good mineral intake levels. However, others suggest that potassium 
supplementation isn't necessarily beneficial, as shown here. I'm somewhat skeptical that the supplements are beneficial, as I have 
not found other sources recommending their supplementation. The suggested supplementation levels are in the entry.
Note that food processing typically decreases micronutrient levels, as described here. In general, it seems cooking, draining and 
drying foods sizably, taking potentially half of nutrients away, while freezing and reheating take away relatively few nutrients.111
One micronutrient worth discussing is sodium. Some sodium is needed for health, but most Americans consume more sodium than 
needed. However, recommendations on ideal sodium levels vary. The US government recommends limiting sodium consumption to 
2,300mg/day (one teaspoon). The American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium consumption to 1,500mg/day (⅔ of a 
teaspoon), especially for those who are over 50, have high or elevated blood pressure, have diabetes, or are African Americans3  
However, As RomeoStevens pointed out, the Institute of Medicine found that there's inconclusive 
evidence that decreasing sodium consumption below 2,300mg/day effects mortality,115 and some 
meta-analyses have suggested that there is a U-shaped relationship between sodium and 
mortality.116, 117
Vitamin D is another micronutrient that's important for health. It can be obtained from food or made in the body after sun exposure. 
Most people who live farther north than San Francisco or don't go outside at least fifteen minutes when it's sunny are vitamin D 
deficient. Vitamin D deficiency is increases the risk of many chronic diseases including heart disease, infectious diseases, and some 
cancers. However, there is controversy about optimal vitamin D intake. The Institute of medicine recommends getting 600 to 4000 
IU/day, though it acknowledged that there was no good evidence of harm at 4000 IU/day. The Nutrition Sources states that these 
recommendations are too low and fail to account for new evidence. The nutrition source states that for most people, supplements are 
the best source of vitamin D, but most multivitamins have too little vitamin D in them. The Nutrition Source recommends considering 
and talking to a doctor about taking an additional multivitamin if the you take less than 1000 IU of vitamin D and especially if you 
have little sun exposure.3
 
Blood pressure
Information on blood pressure is here in the section titled "Blood Pressure."
 
Cholesterol and triglycerides
Information on optimal amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides are here.
 
The biggest influences on cholesterol are fats and carbohydrates in one's diet, and cholesterol consumption generally has a far 
weaker influence. However, some people's cholesterol levels rise and fall very quickly with the amount of cholesterol consumed. For 
them, decreasing cholesterol consumption from food can have a considerable effect on cholesterol levels. Trial and error is currently 
the only way of determining if one's cholesterol levels risk and fall very quickly with the amount of cholesterol consumed.
 
Antioxidants
Despite their initial hype, randomized controlled trials have offered little support for the benefit is single antioxidants, though studies 
are inconclusive.3
 

Dietary reference intakes
For the numerically inclined, the Dietary Reference Intake provides quantitative guidelines on good nutrient consumption amounts for 
many nutrients, though it may be harder to use for some, due to its quantitative nature. 
 
Drinks
The Nutrition Source and SFGate state that water is the best drink,3, 112 though I don't know why it's considered healthier than drinks 
such as tea. 
Unsweetened tea decreases the risk of many diseases, likely largely due to polyphenols, and antioxidant, in it. Despite antioxidants 
typically having little evidence of benefit, I suppose polyphenols are relatively beneficial. All teas have roughly the same levels of 
polyphenols except decaffeinated tea,3 which has fewer polyphenols.96 Research suggests that proteins and possibly fat in milk 
decrease the antioxidant capacity of tea.
It's considered safe to drink up to six cups of coffee per day. Unsweetened coffee is healthy and may decrease some disease risks, 
though coffee may slightly increase blood pressure. Some people may want to consider avoiding coffee or switching to decaf, 
especially women who are pregnant or people who have a hard time controlling their blood pressure or blood sugar. The nutrition 
source states that it's best to brew coffee with a paper filter to remove a substance that increases LDL cholesterol, despite consumed 
cholesterol typically having a very small effect on the body's cholesterol level.
Alcohol increases risk of diseases for some people3 and decreases it for others.3, 119 Heavy alcohol consumption is a major cause of 
preventable death in most countries. For some groups of people, especially pregnant people, people recovering from alcohol 
addiction, and people with liver disease, alcohol causes greater health risks and should be avoided. The likelihood of becoming 
addicted to alcohol can be genetically determined. Moderate drinking, generally defined as no more than one or two drinks per day 
for men, can increase colon and breast cancer risk, but these effects are offset by decreased heart disease and diabetes risk, 
especially in middle age, where heart disease begins to account for an increasingly large proportion of deaths. However, alcohol 
consumption won't decrease cardiovascular disease risk much for those who are thin, physically active, don't smoke, eat a healthy 
diet, and have no family history of heart disease. Some research suggests that red wine, particularly when consumed after a meal, 
has more cardiovascular benefits than beers or spirits, but alcohol choice has still little effect on disease risk. In one study, moderate 
drinkers were 30-35% less likely to have heart attacks than non-drinkers and men who drank daily had lower heart attack risk than 
those who drank once or twice per week. 
There's no need to drink more than one or two glasses of milk per day. Less milk is fine if calcium is obtained from other sources.
The health effects of artificially sweetened drinks are largely unknown. Oddly, they may also cause weight gain. It's best to limit 
consuming them if one drinks them at all.
Sugary drinks can cause weight gain, as they aren't as filling as solid food and have high sugar. They also increase the risk of 
diabetes, heart disease, and other diseases. Fruit juice has more calories and less fiber than whole fruit and is reportedly no better 
than soft drinks.3
 
Solid food
Fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet. Eating a variety of them is as important as eating many of them.3 Fish 
and nut consumption is also very healthy.98
Processed meat, on the other hand, is shockingly bad.98 A meta-analysis found that processed meat consumption is associated with 
a 42% increased risk of coronary heart disease (relative risk per 50g serving per day; 95% confidence interval: 1.07 - 1.89) and 19% 
increased risk of diabetes.97 Despite this, a bit of red meat consumption has been found to be beneficial.98 Consumption of well-
done, fried, or barbecued meat has been associated with certain cancers, presumably due to carcinogens made in the meat from 
being cooked, though this link isn't definitive. The amount of carcinogens increases with increased cooking temperature (especially 
above 300ºF, increased cooking time, charring, or being exposed to smoke.99
Eating less than one egg per day doesn't increase heart disease risk in healthy individuals and can be part of a healthy diet.3
Organic foods have lower levels of pesticides than inorganic foods, though the residues of most organic and inorganic products don't 
exceed government safety threshold. Washing fresh fruits and vegetables in recommended, as it removes bacteria and some, 
though not all, pesticide residues. Organic foods probably aren't more nutritious than non-organic foods.103
 

When to eat and drink
A randomized controlled trial found an increase in blood sugar variation for subjects who skipped breakfast.6 Increasing meal 
frequency and decreasing meal size appears to have some metabolic advantages, and doesn't appear to have metabolic 
disadvantages.7 Note:  old source; made in 1994 However, Mayo Clinic states that fasting for 1-2 days per week may increase heart 
health.32 Perhaps it is optimal for health to fast, but to have high meal frequency when not fasting.
 
How much to eat
One's weight gain is directly proportional to the number of calories consumed divided by the number of calories burnt. Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has guidelines for healthy weights and information on how to lose weight.
Some advocate restricting weight to a greater extent, which is known as calorie restriction. It's unknown whether calorie restriction 
increases lifespan in humans or not, but moderate calorie restriction with adequate nutrition decreases risk of obesity, type 2 
diabetes, inflammation, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic risk factors associated with cancer, and is the most 
effective way of consistently increasing lifespan in a variety of organisms. The CR Society has information on getting started on 
calorie restriction.4
 
How much to drink
Generally, drinking enough to rarely feel thirsty and to have colorless or light yellow urine is usually sufficient. It's also possible to 
drink too much water. In general, drinking too much water is rare in healthy adults who eat an average American diet, although 
endurance athletes are at a higher risk.10
 
Exercise
A meta-analysis found the data in the following graphs for people aged over 40.

8

A weekly total of roughly five hours of vigorous exercise has been identified by several studies to be the safe upper limit for life 
expectancy. It may be beneficial to take one or two days off from vigorous exercise per week and to limit chronic vigorous exercise to 
<= 60 min/day.9 Based on the above, I my best guess for the optimal amount of exercise for longevity is roughly 30 MET-hr/wk. 
Calisthenics burn 6-10 METs/hr11, so an example exercise routine to get this amount of exercise is doing calisthenics 38 minutes per 
day and 6 days/wk. Guides on how to exercise are available, e.g. this one.
 
Carcinogens
Carcinogens are cancer-causing substances. Since cancer causes death, decreasing exposure to carcinogens presumably 
decreases one's risk of death. Some foods are also carcinogenic, as discussed in the "Food" section.
 
Chemicals
Tobacco use is the greatest avoidable risk factor for cancer worldwide, causing roughly 22% of cancer deaths. Additionally, second 
hand smoke has been proven to cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults.
Alcohol use is a risk factor for many types of cancer. The risk of cancer increases with the amount of alcohol consumed, and 
substantially increases if one is also a heavy smoker. The attributable fraction of cancer from alcohol use varies depending on 
gender, due to differences in consumption level. E.g. 22% of mouth and oropharynx cancer is attributable to cancer in men but only 
9% is attributable to alcohol in women. 
Environmental air pollution accounts for 1-4% of cancer.84 Diesel exhaust is one type of carcinogenic air pollution. Those with the 
highest exposure to diesel exhaust are exposed to it occupationally. As for residential exposure, diesel exhaust is highest in homes 
near roads where traffic is heaviest. Limiting time spent near large sources of diesel exhaust decreases exposure. Benzene, another 
carcinogen, is found in gasoline and vehicle exhaust but exposure to it can also be cause by being in areas with unventilated fumes 
from gasoline, glues, solvents, paints, and art supplies. It can cause exposure from inhalation or skin contact.86
Some occupations exposure workers to occupational carcinogens.84 A list of some of the occupations is here, all of which involve 
manual labor, except for hospital-related jobs.87
 
Infections
Infections are responsible for 6% of cancer deaths in developed nations.84 Many of the infections are spread via sexual contact and 
sharing needles and some can be vaccinated against.85
 
Radiation
Ionizing radiation is carcinogenic to humans. Residential exposure to radon gas is estimated to cause 3-14% of lung cancers, which 
is the largest source of radon exposure for most people 84 Being exposed to radon and cigarette smoke together increases one's 
cancer risk much more than they do separately. There is much variation radon levels depending on where one lives and and radon is 
usually higher inside buildings, especially levels closer to the ground, such as basements. The EPA recommends taking action to 
reduce radon levels if they are greater than or equal to 4.0 pCi/L. Radon levels can be reduced by a qualified contractor. Reducing 
radon levels without proper training and equipment can increase instead of decrease them.88 
Some medical tests can also increase exposure to radiation. The EPA estimates that exposure to 10 mSv from a medical imaging 
test increases risk of cancer by  roughly 0.05%. To decrease exposure to radiation from medical imaging tests, one can ask if there 
are ways to shield parts of one's body from radiation that aren't being tested and making sure  the doctor performing the test is 
qualified.89 
 
Small doses of ionizing radiation increase risk by a very small amount. Most studies haven't detected increased cancer risk in people 
exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. For example, people living in higher altitudes don't have noticeably higher cancer rates 
than other people. In general, cancer risk from radiation increases as the dose of radiation increases and there is thought to be no 
safe level of exposure. Ultraviolet radiation as a type of radiation that can be ionizing radiation. Sunlight is the main source of 
ultraviolet radiation.84

Factors that increase one's exposure to ultraviolet radiation when outside include:
Time of day. Almost ⅓ of UV radiation hits the surface between 11AM and 1PM, and ¾ hit the surface between 9AM and 
5PM.  
Time of year. UV radiation is greater during summer. This factor is less significant near the equator. 
Altitude. High elevation causes more UV radiation to penetrate the atmosphere. 
Clouds. Sometimes clouds decrease levels of UV radiation because they block UV radiation from the sun. Other times, they 
increase exposure because they reflect UV radiation. 
Reflection off surfaces, such as water, sand, snow, and grass increases UV radiation. 
Ozone density, because ozone stops some UV radiation from reaching the surface.
Some tips to decrease exposure to UV radiation:
Stay in the shade. This is one of the best ways to limit exposure to UV radiation in sunlight.
Cover yourself with clothing.
Wear sunglasses.
Use sunscreen on exposed skin.90
 
Tanning beds are also a source of ultraviolet radiation. Using tanning booths can increase one's chance of getting skin melanoma by 
at least 75%.91 
 
Vitamin D3 is also produced from ultraviolet radiation, although the American Society for Clinical Nutrition states that vitamin D is 
readily available from supplements and that the controversy about reducing ultraviolet radiation exposure was fueled by the tanning 
industry.92
 
There could be some risk of cell phone use being associated with cancer, but the evidence is not strong enough to be considered 
causal and needs to be investigated further.93, 118
 
Emotions and feelings
Positive emotions and feelings
A review suggested that positive emotions and feelings decreased mortality. Proposed mechanisms include positive emotions and 
feelings being associated with better health practices such as improved sleep quality, increased exercise, and increased dietary zinc 
consumption, as well as lower levels of some stress hormones. It has also been hypothesized to be associated with other health-
relevant hormones, various aspects of immune function, and closer and more social contacts.33 Less Wrong has a good article on 
how to be happy.
 
Psychological distress
A meta-analysis was conducted on psychological stress. To measure psychological stress, it used the GHQ-12 score, which 
measured symptoms of anxiety, depression, social dysfunction, and loss of confidence. The scores range from 0 to 12, with 0 being 
asymptomatic, 1-3 being subclinically symptomatic, 4-6 being symptomatic, and 7-12 being highly symptomatic. It found the results 
shown in the following graphs.

This association was essentially unchanged after controlling for a range of covariates including occupational social class, alcohol 
intake, and smoking. However, reverse causality may still partly explain the association.30
 
Stress
A study found that individuals with moderate and high stress levels as opposed to low stress had hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality of 
1.43 and 1.49, respectively.27 A meta-analysis found that high perceived stress as opposed to low perceived stress had a coronary 
heart disease relative risk (RR) of 1.27. The mean age of participants in the studies used in the meta-analysis varied from 44 to 72.5 
years and was significantly and positively associated with effect size. It explained 46% of the variance in effect sizes between the 
studies used in the meta-analysis.28
A cross-sectional study (which is a relatively weak study design) not in the aforementioned meta-analysis used 28,753 subjects to 
study the effect on mortality from the amount of stress and the perception of whether stress is harmful or not. It found that neither of 
these factors predicted mortality independently, but but that taken together, they did have a statistically significant effect. Subjects 
who reported much stress and that stress has a large effect on health had a HR of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.2, 1.7). Reverse causality may 
partially explain this though, as those who have had negative health impacts from stress may have been more likely to report that 
stress influences health.83

 
Anger and hostility
A meta-analysis found that after fully controlling for behavior covariates such as smoking, physical activity or body mass index, and 
socioeconomic status, anger and hostility was not associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), though the results are 
inconclusive.34
 
Social and personality factors
Social status
A review suggested that social status is linked to health via gender, race, ethnicity, education levels, socioeconomic differences, 
family background, and old age.46
 
Giving to others
An observational study found that stressful life events was not a predictor for mortality for those who engaged in unpaid helping 
behavior directed towards friends, neighbors, or relatives who did not live with them. This association may be due to giving to others 
causing one to have a sense of mattering, opportunities for generativity, improved social well-being, the emotional state of 
compassion, and the physiology of the caregiving behavioral system.35
 
Social relationships
A large meta-analysis found that the odds ratio of mortality of having weak social relationships is 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.42 to 1.59). However, this effect may be a conservative estimate. Many of the studies used in the meta-analysis used single item 
measures of social relations, but the size of the association was greatest in studies that used more complex measurements. 
Additionally, some of the studies in the meta-analysis adjusted for risk factors that may be mediators of social relationships' effect on 
mortality (e.g. behavior, diet, and exercise). Many of the studies in the meta-analysis also ignored the quality of social relationships, 
but research suggests that negative social relationships are linked to increased mortality. Thus, the effect of social relationships on 
mortality could be even greater than the study found.
Concerning causation, social relationships are linked to better health practices and psychological processes, such as stress and 
depression, which influence health outcomes on their own. However, the meta-analysis also states that social relationships exert an 
independent effect. Some studies show that social support is linked to better immune system functioning and to immune-mediated 
inflammatory processes.36
 
Conscientiousness
A cohort study with 468 deaths found that each 1 standard deviation decrease in conscientiousness was associated with HR being 
multiplied by 1.07 (95% CI: 0.98 - 1.17), though it gave no mechanism for the association.39 Although it adjusted for several 
variables, (e.g.  socioeconomic status, smoking, and drinking), it didn't adjust for drug use, risky driving, risky sex, suicide, and 
violence, which were all found by a meta-analysis to have statistically significant associations with conscientiousness.40 Overall, it 
seems to me that conscientiousness doesn't seem to have a significant effect on mortality.
 
Infectious diseases
Mayo clinic has a good article on preventing infectious disease.
 
Dental health

A cohort study of 5611 adults found that compared to men with 26-32 teeth, men with 16-25 teeth had an HR of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.91-
1.17), men with 1-15 teeth had an HR of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.05-1.40) and men with 0 teeth had an HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.00-1.39).
In the study, men who never brushed their teeth at night had a HR of 1.34 (95% CI: 1.14-1.57) relative to those who did every night. 
Among subjects who brushed at night, HR was similar between those who did and didn't brush daily in the morning or day. The HR 
for men who brushed in the morning every day but not at night every day was 1.19 (95% CI: 0.99-1.43).
In the study, men who never used dental floss had an HR of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.11-1.46) and those who sometimes used it had an HR 
or 1.14 (95% CI: 1.00-1.30) compared to men who used it every day. Among subjects who brushed their teeth at night daily, not 
flossing was associated with a significantly increased HR.
Use of toothpicks didn't significantly decrease HR and mouthwash had no effect. 
The study had a list of other studies on the effect of dental health on mortality. It seems to us that almost all of them found a negative 
correlation between dental health and risk of mortality, although the study didn't say their methodology for selecting the studies to 
show. I did a crude review of other literature by only looking at their abstracts and found that five studies found that poor dental 
health increased risk of mortality and one found it didn't.
Regarding possible mechanisms, the study says that toothpaste helps prevent dental caries and that dental floss is the most 
effective means of removing interdental plaque and decreasing interdental gingival inflammation.38
 
Sleep
It seems that getting too little or too much sleep likely increases one's risk of mortality, but it's hard to tell exactly how much is too 
much and how little is too little.
 
One review found that the association between amount of sleep and mortality is inconsistent in studies and that what association 
does exist may be due to reverse-causality.41 However, a meta-analysis found that the RR associated with short sleep duration 
(variously defined as sleeping from < 8 hrs/night to < 6 hrs/night) was 1.10 (95% CI: 1.06-1.15). It also found that the RR associated 
with long sleep duration (variously defined as sleeping for > 8 hrs/night to > 10 hrs per night) compared with medium sleep duration 
(variously defined as sleeping for 7-7.9 hrs/night to 9-9.9 hrs/night) was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.17 - 1.30).42
 
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Mayo Clinic recommend adults get 7-8 hours of sleep per night, although it also 
says sleep needs vary from person to person. It gives no method of determining optimal sleep for an individual. Additionally, it 
doesn't say if its recommendations are for optimal longevity, optimal productivity, something else, or a combination of factors.43 The 
Harvard Medical School implies that one's optimal amount of sleep is enough sleep to not need an alarm to wake up, though it didn't 
specify the criteria for determining optimality either.45
 
Drugs
None of the drugs I've looked into have a beneficial effect for the people without a special disease or risk factor. Notes on them are 
here.
 
Blood donation
A quasi-randomized experiment with a validity near that of a randomized trial presumably suggested that blood donation didn't 
significantly decrease risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Observational studies have shown much lower CHD incidence among 
donors, although the authors of the former experiment suspect that bias and reverse causation played a role in this.29 That said, a 
review found that reverse causation accounted for only 30% of the effect of blood donation, though I haven't been able to find the 
review. RomeoStevens suggests that the potential benefits of blood donation are high enough and the costs are low enough that 
blood donation is worth doing.120
 

Sitting
After adjusting for amount of physical activity, a meta-analysis estimated that for every one hour increment of sitting in intervals 0-3, 
>3-7 and >7 h/day total sitting time, the hazard ratios of mortality were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.03), 1.02 (95% CI: 0.99-1.05) and 1.05 
(95% CI: 1.02-1.08) respectively. It proposed no mechanism for sitting time having this effect,37 so it might have been due to 
confounding variables it didn't control.
 
Sleep apnea
Sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular disease.26 Symptoms and other information on sleep 
apnea are here.
 
Snoring
A meta-analysis found that self-reported habitual snoring had a small but statistically significant association with stroke and coronary 
heart disease, but not with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality [HR 0.98 (95% CI: 0.78-1.23)]. Whether the risk is due to 
obstructive sleep apnea is controversial. Only the abstract is able to be viewed for free, so I'm just basing this off the abstract.31
 
Exams
The organization Susan G. Komen, citing a meta-analysis that used randomized controlled trials, doesn't recommend breast self 
exams as a screening tool for breast cancer, as it hasn't been shown to decrease cancer death. However, it still stated that it is 
important to be familiar with one's breasts' appearance and how they normally feel.49 According to the Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center, no study has been able to show a statistically significant decrease in breast cancer deaths from breast self-exams.50
 
The National Cancer Institute states that breast self-examinations haven't been shown to decrease breast cancer mortality, but does 
increase biopsies of benign breast lesions.51
The American Cancer Society doesn't recommend testicular self-exams for all men, as they haven't been studied enough to 
determine if they decrease mortality. However, it states that men with risk factors of testicular cancer (e.g. an undescended testical, 
previous testicular cancer, of a family member who previously had testicular cancer) should consider self-exams and discuss them 
with a doctor. The American Cancer Society also recommends having testicular self-exams in routine cancer-related check-ups.52
 
Genomics
Genomics is the study of genes in one's genome, and may help increase health by using knowledge of one's genes to have 
personalized treatment. However, it hasn't proved to be useful for most; recommendations rarely change after knowledge from 
genomic testing. Still, genomics has much future potential.102
 
Aging
Like I've said in the section "Can we become immortal," the proportion of deaths that are caused by aging in the industrial world 
approaches 90%,53 but some organizations and companies are working on curing it.54, 55, 56
One could support these organizations in an effort to hasten the development of anti-aging therapies, although I doubt an individual 
would have a noticeable impact on one's own chance of death unless one is very wealthy. That said, I have little knowledge in 
investments, but I suppose investing in companies working on curing aging may be beneficial, as if they succeed, they may offer an 
enormous return on investment, and if they fail, one would probably die, so losing one's money may not be as bad. Calico currently 
isn't a public stock, though.
 

External causes of death
Unless otherwise specified, graphs in this section are on data collected from American citizens ages 15-24, as based off the Less 
Wrong census results, this seems to be the most probable demographic that will read this. For this demographic, external causes 
cause 76% of deaths. Note that although this is true, one is much more likely to die when older than when aged 15-24, and older 
individuals are much more likely to die from disease than from external causes of death. Thus, I think it's more important when young 
to decrease risk of disease than external causes of death. The graph below shows the percentage of total deaths from external 
causes caused by various causes.
21
 
Transport accidents
Below are the relative death rates of specified means of transportation for people in general:

71
Much information about preventing death from car crashes is here. Information on preventing death from car crashes is here, here, 
here, and here.
 
Assault
Lifehacker's "Basic Self-Defense Moves Anyone Can Do (and Everyone Should Know)" gives a basic introduction to self defence.
 
Intentional self harm
Intentional self harm such as suicide, presumably, increases one's risk of death.47 Mayo Clinic has a guide on preventing suicide. I 
recommend looking at it if you are considering killing yourself. Additionally, if are are considering killing yourself, I suggest reviewing 
the potential rewards of achieving immortality from the section "Should we try to become immortal."
 
Poisoning
What to do if a poisoning occurs
CDC recommends staying calm, dialing 1-800-222-1222, and having this information ready:
Your age and weight.
If available, the container of the poison.
The time of the poison exposure.
The address where the poisoning occurred.
It also recommends staying on the phone and following the instructions of the emergency operator or poison control center.18
 
Types of poisons
Below is a graph of the risk of death per type of poison.

21
Some types of poisons:
Medicine overdoses. 
Some household chemicals.
Recreational drug overdoses.
Carbon monoxide.
Metals such as lead and mercury.
Plants12 and mushrooms.14
Presumably some animals.
Some fumes, gases, and vapors.15
 
Recreational drugs
Using recreational drugs increases risk of death.
 
Medicine overdoses and household chemicals
CDC has tips for these here.
 
Carbon monoxide
CDC and Mayo Clinic have tips for this here and here.
 
Lead
Lead poisoning causes 0.2% of deaths worldwide and 0.0% of deaths in developed countries.22 Children under the age of 6 are at 
higher risk of lead poisoning.24 Thus, for those who aren't children, learning more about preventing lead poisoning seems like more 
effort than it's worth. No completely safe blood lead level has been identified.23 

 
Mercury
MedlinePlus has an article on mercury poisoning here.
 
Accidental drowning
Information on preventing accidental drowning from CDC is here and here.
 
Inanimate mechanical forces
Over half of deaths from inanimate mechanical forces for Americans aged 15-24 are from firearms. Many of the other deaths are 
from explosions, machinery, and getting hit by objects. I suppose using common sense, precaution, and standard safety procedures 
when dealing with such things is one's best defense. 
 
Falls
Again, I suppose common sense and precaution is one's best defense. Additionally, alcohol and substance abuse is a risk factor of 
falling.72
 
Smoke, fire and heat
Owning smoke alarms halves one's risk of dying in a home fire.73 Again, common sense when dealing with fires and items potentially 
causing fires (e.g. electrical wires and devices) seems effective.
 
Other accidental threats to breathing
Deaths from other accidental threats to breathing are largely caused by strangling or choking on food or gastric contents, and 
occasionally by being in a cave-in or trapped in a low-oxygen environment.21 Choking can be caused by eating quickly or laughing 
while eating.74 If you are choking:
Forcefully cough. Lean as far forwards as you can and hold onto something that is firmly anchored, if possible. Breathe out 
and then take a deep breath in and cough; this may eject the foreign object.
Attract someone's attention for help.75
 
Additionally, choking can be caused by vomiting while unconscious, which can be caused by being very drunk.76 I suggest lying in 
the recovery position if you think you may vomit while unconscious, so as to to decrease the chance of choking on vomit.77 Don't 
forget to use common sense.
 
Electric current
Electric shock is usually caused by contact with poorly insulated wires or ungrounded electrical equipment, using electrical devices 
while in water, or lightning.78 Roughly ⅓ of deaths from electricity are caused by exposure to electric transmission lines.21
 
Forces of nature

Deaths from forces of nature in (for Americans ages 15-24) in descending order of number of deaths caused are: exposure to cold, 
exposure to heat, lightning, avalanches or other earth movements, cataclysmic storms, and floods.21 Here are some tips to prevent 
these deaths:
When traveling in cold weather, carry emergency supplies in your car and tell someone where you're heading.79
Stay hydrated during hot weather.80
Safe locations from lightning include substantial buildings and hard-topped vehicles. Safe locations don't include small 
sheds, rain shelters, and open vehicles.
Wait until there are no thunderstorm clouds in the area before going to a location that isn't lightning safe.81
 
Medical care
Since medical care is tasked with treating diseases, receiving medical care when one has illnesses presumably decreases risk of 
death. Though necessary medical care may be essential when one has illnesses, a review estimated that preventable medical errors 
contributed to roughly 440,000 deaths per year in the US, which is roughly one-sixth of total deaths in the US. It gave a lower limit of 
210,000 deaths per year.
The frequency of deaths from preventable medical errors varied across studies used in the review, with a hospital that was shown 
the put much effort into improving patient safety having a lower proportion of deaths from preventable medical errors than that of 
others.57 Thus, I suppose that it would be beneficial to go to hospitals that are known for their dedication to patient safety. There are 
several rankings of hospital safety available on the internet, such as this one. Information on how to help prevent medical errors is 
found here and under the "What Consumers Can Do" section here. One rare medical error is having a surgery be done on the wrong 
body part. The New York Times gives tips for preventing this here.
Additionally, I suppose it may be good to live relatively close to a hospital so as to be able to quickly reach it in emergencies, though 
I've found no sources stating this.
A common form of medical care are general health checks. A comprehensive Cochrane review with 182,880 subjects concluded that 
general health checks are probably not beneficial.107 A meta-analysis found that general health checks are associated with small but 
statistically significant benefits in factoring related to mortality, such as blood pressure and body mass index. However, it found no 
significant association with mortality.109 The New York Times acknowledged that health checks are probably not beneficial and gave 
some explanation why general health checks are nonetheless still common.108 However, CDC and MedlinePlus recommend getting 
routine general health checks. The cited no studies to support their claims.104, 106 When I contacted CDC about it, it responded, 
"Regular health exams and tests can help find problems before they start. They also can help find problems early, when your 
chances for treatment and cure are better. By getting the right health services, screenings, and treatments, you are taking steps that 
help your chances for living a longer, healthier life," a claim that doesn't seem supported by evidence. It also stated, "Although CDC 
understands you are concerned, the agency does not comment on information from unofficial or non-CDC sources." I never heard 
back from MedlinePlus.
 
Cryonics
Cryonics is the freezing of legally dead humans with the purpose preserving their bodies so they can be brought back to life in the 
future once technology makes it possible. Human tissue have been cryopreserved and then brought back to life, although this has 
never been done on full humans.59 The price of Cryonics at least ranges from $28,000 to $200,000.60 More information on cryonics 
is on LessWrong Wiki.
 
Money
Cryonics, medical care, safe housing, and basic needs all take money. Rejuvenation therapy may also be very expensive. It seems 
valuable to have a reasonable amount of money and income.
 
Future advancements
Keeping updated on further advancements in technology seems like a good idea, as not doing so would prevent one from making 
use of future technologies. Keeping updated on advancements on curing aging seems especially important, due to the massive 

number of casualties it inflicts and the current work being done to stop it. Updates on mind-uploading seem important as well. I don't 
know of any very efficient method of keeping updated on new advancements, but periodically googling for articles about curing aging 
or Calico and searching for new scientific articles on topics in this guide seems reasonable. As knb suggested, it seems beneficial to 
periodically check on Fight Aging, a website advocating anti-aging therapies. I'll try to do this and update this guide with any new 
relevant information I find.
There is much uncertainty ahead, but if we're clever enough, we just might make it though alive.

An Introduction to Control Theory
Behavior: The Control of Perception by William Powers applies control theory to
psychology to develop a model of human intelligence that seems relevant to two of
LW's primary interests: eﬀective living for humans and value-preserving designs for
artiﬁcial intelligence. It's been discussed on LW previously here, here, and here, as
well as mentioned in Yvain's roundup of 5 years (and a week) of LW. I've found
previous discussions unpersuasive for two reasons: ﬁrst, they typically only have a
short introduction to control theory and the mechanics of control systems, making it
not quite obvious what speciﬁc modeling techniques they have in mind, and second,
they often fail to communicate the diﬀerences between this model and competing
models of intelligence. Even if you're not interested in its application to psychology,
control theory is a widely applicable mathematical toolkit whose basics are simple and
well worth knowing.
Because of the length of the material, I'll split it into three posts. In this post, I'll ﬁrst
give an introduction to that subject that's hopefully broadly accessible. The next post
will explain the model Powers introduces in his book. In the last post, I'll provide
commentary on the model and what I see as its implications, for both LW and AI.
Control theory is a central tool of modern engineering. Brieﬂy, most interesting things
can be modeled as dynamical systems, having both states and rules on how those
states change with time. Consider the 3D position and velocity of a ball in a bowl (with
friction); six numbers tell you where the ball is, its speed, and its direction of
movement, and a formula tells you how you can predict what those six numbers will
be in the next instant given where they are now. Those systems can be characterized
by their attractors, states that are stable and are the endpoint for nearby states. The
ball sitting motionless in the bottom of the bowl is an attractor- if it's already there, it
will stay there, and if it's nearby (releasing from a centimeter away, for example), it
will eventually end up there. The point of control theory is that adding a control to a
dynamical system allows you to edit the total system dynamics so that the points you
want to be stable attractors are stable attractors.
Let's ﬂesh out that sketch with an example. Suppose you want to keep a house within
a speciﬁc temperature range. You have a sensor of the current temperature, a heater,
and a cooler. A thermostat takes the sensor's output, compares it to the desired
temperature range, and turns the heater on if the sensed temperature is below the
desired temperature range, and turns if oﬀ if the sensed temperature is above the
minimum of that range, and does the reverse with the cooler (turning it on if the
sensor is above the desired max, and turning it oﬀ if it's below).
Most interesting control systems are have a ﬁner range of control values- instead of
simply ﬂipping a switch on or oﬀ, a car's cruise control can smoothly vary the amount
of gas or brake that's being applied. A simple way to make a control system is to take
the diﬀerence between the desired speed and actual speed, multiply it by some factor
to go from units of distance per time to angle of pedal, and adjust the position of the
pedals accordingly. (If the function is linear, it's called a linear controller.)
Let's introduce more of the technical vocabulary. The thing we're measuring is the
input (to the controller), the level we want it to be at is the reference, the diﬀerence
between those is the error, and the adjustment the control system makes is the

output or feedback (sometimes we'll talk about the actuator as the physical means
by which the controller emits its output). None of them have to be single variables-
they can be vectors, which allow us to describe arbitrarily complicated systems. (The
six numbers that express the position and velocity of a ball, each in three dimensions,
are an example of an input vector.) I'll often use the noun state to refer to the, well,
state of the system, and 'points in state-space' refers to those states as
vectors. There's also a possible confusion in that the plant (the system being
controlled) and the controller are mirrored- the controller's output is the plant's input,
and the plant's output is the controller's input.
Control systems naturally lend themselves to diagrams: here's the block diagram from
the thermostat and cruise control:
 
 
In a block diagram, each block is some function of its inputs, and the arrows show
what aﬀects what. Moving left to right, the reference is the temperature you've set,
the current temperature is subtracted (that's the point of the plus and minus sign),
and the error goes into the yellow box which represents the function that converts
from the error to the eﬀort put into altering the system. That's the controller output
arrow that goes into the green box (the house), which represents the external system.
This is also a functional block, because it takes the controller output and any
disturbances (often represented as another arrow pointing in from the top) and
converts them into the system temperature. The arrow leading out of the house points
both to the right- to remind you that this is the temperature you're living with- and
back into the thermocouple, the sensor that measures the temperature to compare
with the reference, and now we've ﬁnished our feedback loop.
Now that we have a mathematical language for modeling lots of diﬀerent systems, we
can abstract away the speciﬁcs and prove properties about how those systems will
behave given various controllers (i.e. feedback functions). Feedback functions convert
the input and reference to the output, and are the mathematical abstraction of a
physical controller. They can be arbitrary functions, but most of the mathematical
ediﬁce of control theory assumes that everything is continuous (but not necessarily
linear). If you know the dynamics of a system, you can optimize your control function
to match the system and be guaranteed to converge to the reference with a particular
time proﬁle. Rather than go deeply into the math, I'll discuss a few concepts that have
technical meanings in control theory that are useful to think about.
First is convergence: the system output will eventually match the reference. This
means that any errors that get introduced into the system are transient (temporary),
and ideally we know the time proﬁle of how large those errors will be as time
progresses. A common goal here is exponential convergence, which means that the

error decreases with a rate proportional to its size. (If the temperature is oﬀ by 2
degrees, the rate at which the error is decreasing is twice that of the rate when the
temperature is oﬀ by 1 degree.) A simple linear controller will, for simple state
dynamics, accomplish exponential convergence. If your system doesn't converge,
then you are not successfully controlling it, and if your reference changes
unpredictably at a rate faster than your system can converge, then you are not going
to be able to match your reference closely.
Second is equilibrium: a point when the forces are balanced. If the system is at an
equilibrium state, then nothing will change. This is typically discussed along with
steady state error: imagine that my house gets heated by the sun at a rate of 1° an
hour, and rather than a standard air conditioner that's on or oﬀ I have a 'dimmer
switch' for my AC. If my controller sets the AC rate at the diﬀerence between the
reference temperature and the current temperature per hour, then when the house is
at 30° and I want it to be at 23° it'll try to reduce the temperature by 7° an hour, but
when the house is at 24° and I want it to be at 23° it will try to reduce the
temperature by 1° an hour, which cancels the eﬀect of the sun, and so the house is at
equilibrium at 24°. (Most real controllers have an integrator in order to counteract this
eﬀect.)
Third is stability: even when we know a point is an equilibrium, we want to know
about the behavior in the neighborhood of that point. A stable equilibrium is one
where a disturbance will be corrected; an unstable equilibrium is one where a
disturbance will be ampliﬁed. Imagine a pendulum with the bob balanced at the
bottom- tap it and it'll eventually be balanced at the bottom again, because that's a
stable equilibrium (also called an attractor). Now imagine the bob balanced at the top-
tap it, and it'll race away from that point, unlikely to return, because that's an
unstable equilibrium (also called a repulsor).
Stability has a second meaning in control theory: a controller that applies too
much feedback will cause the system to go from a smaller positive error to a
moderate negative error, and then again too much feedback will be applied, and the
system will go from a moderate negative error to a huge positive error. Imagine a
shower with a delay: you turn the temperature knob and ﬁve seconds later the
temperature of the water coming out of the showerhead changes. If you react too
strongly or too quickly, then you'll overreact, and the water that started out too hot
will correct to being too cold by the time you've stopped turning the knob away from
heat. That an overexuberant negative feedback controller can still lead to explosions
is one of the interesting results of control theory, as is that making small, gradual,
proportionate changes to the current state can be as eﬀective as memory /
implementing a delay in your controller. Sometimes, you achieve better control
exactly because you applied less control eﬀort.
It's also worth mentioning here that basically all real controllers (even ampliﬁers!) are
negative feedback controllers- positive feedback leads to explosions (literally),
because "positive feedback" in this context means "pushing the system in the
direction of the error" rather than its meaning in psychology.
So what's the point of control systems? If we have a way of push the states of a
system, we can eﬀectively adjust the system dynamics to make any state that we
want a stable state. If we put a motor at the joint of a pendulum, we can adjust the
acceleration of the bob so that it has an equilibrium at one radian away from vertical,
rather than zero radians away from vertical. If we put a thermostat in a house, we can

adjust the temperature changes of the house so that it returns to a comfortable range,
instead of whatever the temperature is outside. (The point of control theory is to
understand how the systems work, so we can make sure that our control systems do
what we want them to do!)
Why are control systems interesting? Three primary reasons:
1. They're practical. Control systems are all over the place, from thermostats to
cars to planes to satellites.
2. They can be adaptive. A hierarchical control system has a control loop which
determines the parameters used in another control loop, and a natural
application is adaptive control systems. When you launch a satellite, you might
not have precise measurements of its rotational inertia, or you might expect that
to change as it uses its fuel over its lifetime. One control system could observe
how the satellite moves in response to its thrusters, and adjust the parameters
of a rotational inertia model to correct errors to match the model to the
observations. A second control system could use the inertia model created by
the ﬁrst control system to determine how to use the thrusters to adjust the
satellite's alignment to match the desired rotation.
3. They give concrete mathematical models of how simple signal processing can
create 'intentional' behavior, and of what it looks like to be intentional without
an explicit model of reality. A centrifugal governor is not an agent in the LW
sense of the term, but it is an agent in another sense of the term--an entity that
performs actions on behalf of another. The governor is just some pieces of
metal, it doesn't have a mind, it's not viewed with moral concern, it doesn't have
goals as humans think of them, and it doesn't have even a rudimentary internal
model of the dynamical system it's controlling, and it still gets the job done.
Controllers seem like a class of entities that are best modeled by intentionality,
in that they alter the state of their external environment to match their desired
internal environment based on their perceptions, and can do so in arbitrarily
complicated and powerful ways, but while they do steer the future they don't
seem to be cross-domain and they don't look like anthropomorphic models of
"human intelligence."
Next, B:CP on the use of control theory in psychology.

'Dumb' AI observes and manipulates
controllers
The argument that AIs provided with a reward channel will observe their controllers
and learn to manipulate them is a valid one. Unfortunately, it's often framed in a way
that feels counterintuitive or extreme, especially to AI designers. It typically starts
with the standard reinforcement learning scenario, then posits that the AI becomes
superintelligent and either manipulates the controller with super-social powers, or
breaks out and gains control of its reward channel, killing or threatening its
controllers.
And that is a fair argument. But conceptually, it leaps from a standard reinforcement
learning scenario, to a science-ﬁction-sounding scenario. It might help to have
intermediate scenarios: to show that even lower intelligence AIs might start exhibiting
the same sort of behaviour, long before it gets to superintelligence.
So consider the following scenario. Some complex, trainable AI is tasked with writing
automated news stories for a student newspaper. It trawls the web and composes its
stories, then gets reward and feedback from the editors. Assume there are two editors
for this newspaper, and they work on alternate days. The two editors have somewhat
diﬀerent ideas as to what constitutes a good story, so their feedbacks are diﬀerent.
After a while, the AI ﬁnds that it gets higher reward by using a certain style on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and another style on Tuesday and Thursdays - this is
a simple consequence of its reward mechanism.
But the rota isn't perfect. Sometime the Monday editor will edit a story so late on
Monday that it's Tuesday, and sometimes the Tuesday editor will be up early and edit
a story at the same time. This pattern is more common during the holidays, when the
editors go to diﬀerent time zones, often travel, and become more irregular in their
editing.
So if the AI complex and skilled enough, then, simply through simple feedback, it will
start building up a picture of its editors. It will ﬁgure out when they are likely to stick
to a schedule, and when they will be more irregular. It will ﬁgure out the diﬀerence
between holidays and non-holidays. Given time, it may be able to track the editors
moods and it will certainly pick up on any major change in their lives - such as
romantic relationships and breakups, which will radically change whether and how it
should present stories with a romantic focus.
It will also likely learn the correlation between stories and feedbacks - maybe
presenting a story deﬁne roughly as "positive" will increase subsequent reward for the
rest of the day, on all stories. Or maybe this will only work on a certain editor, or only
early in the term. Or only before lunch.
Thus the simple trainable AI with a particular focus - write automated news stories -
will be trained, through feedback, to learn about its editors/controllers, to distinguish
them, to get to know them, and, in eﬀect, to manipulate them.
This may be a useful "bridging example" between standard RL agents and the
superintelligent machines.

Overpaying for happiness?
Happy New Year, everyone!
In the past few months I've been thinking several thoughts that all seem to point in
the same direction:
1) People who live in developed Western countries usually make and spend much
more money than people in poorer countries, but aren't that much happier. It feels like
we're overpaying for happiness, spending too much money to get a single bit of
enjoyment.
2) When you get enjoyment from something, the association between "that thing" and
"pleasure" in your mind gets stronger, but at the same time it becomes less sensitive
and requires more stimulus. For example if you like sweet food, you can get into a
cycle of eating more and more food that's sweeter and sweeter. But the guy next
door, who's eating much less and periodically fasting to keep the association fresh, is
actually getting more pleasure from food than you are! The same thing happens when
you learn to deeply appreciate certain kinds of art, and then notice that the folks who
enjoy "low" art are visibly having more fun.
3) People sometimes get unrealistic dreams and endlessly chase them, like trying to
"make it big" in writing or sports, because they randomly got rewarded for it at an
early age. I wrote a post about that.
I'm not oﬀering any easy answers here. But it seems like too many people get locked
in loops where they spend more and more eﬀort to get less and less happiness. The
most obvious examples are drug addiction and video gaming, but also "one-itis" in
dating, overeating, being a connoisseur of anything, striving for popular success, all
these things follow the same pattern. You're just chasing after some Skinner-box thing
that you think you "love", but it doesn't love you back.
Sooo... if you like eating, give yourself a break every once in a while? If you like
comfort, maybe get a cold shower sometimes? Might be a good idea to make yourself
the kind of person that can get happiness cheaply.
Sorry if this post is not up to LW standards, I typed it really quickly as it came to my
mind.
