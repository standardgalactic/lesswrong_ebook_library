1. Guidelines for cold messaging people

Guidelines for cold messaging people
I just received a random email from a stranger in which they ask me 5-10 hard-to-
answer questions on eﬀective altruism, emotional health, and moral cluelessness that
bother them.
Reﬂecting on this, I came up with a list of eight rules of thumb you might want to
consider when you cold message someone. You might not want to address all of them
in every message (because that contradicts no. 8), but they may be a good pointer
towards what would make people keener to respond:
 
1. Add a one-sentence introduction so they know how to interact with you.
2. Make clear how you got hold of their email address.
3. Make clear why they may want to talk to you.
4. Make clear why you think they are the right person to solve your problem.
5. Courteously emphasize that you don't mind if they are too busy to respond.
6. Start or end with a note of praise or gratitude.
7. Ask for their permission *before* you dump a long list of questions or any other kind
of work on them. To minimize friction and time investment for them, add your list of
questions to the ﬁrst email right away. However, make clear that it is okay and
encouraged for them to say *no*. For example, lead with a sentence like "Here are
some questions I'm trying to answer for myself. Of course, no worries if you are too
busy to help me with that."
8. Keep the message as short and clear as possible.
 
Let me know if there's anything you ﬁnd valuable that I overlooked.
