Are we in an AI overhang?
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
Over on Developmental Stages of GPTs, orthonormal mentions
it at least reduces the chance of a hardware overhang.
An overhang is when you have had the ability to build transformative AI for quite
some time, but you haven't because no-one's realised it's possible. Then someone
does and surprise! It's a lot more capable than everyone expected.
I am worried we're in an overhang right now. I think we right now have the ability to
build an orders-of-magnitude more powerful system than we already have, and I think
GPT-3 is the trigger for 100x larger projects at Google, Facebook and the like, with
timelines measured in months.
Investment Bounds
GPT-3 is the ﬁrst AI system that has obvious, immediate, transformative economic
value. While much hay has been made about how much more expensive it is than a
typical AI research project, in the wider context of megacorp investment, its costs are
insigniﬁcant.
GPT-3 has been estimated to cost $5m in compute to train, and - looking at the author
list and OpenAI's overall size - maybe another $10m in labour.
Google, Amazon and Microsoft each spend about $20bn/year on R&D and another
$20bn each on capital expenditure. Very roughly, it totals to $100bn/year. Against this
budget, dropping $1bn or more on scaling GPT up by another factor of 100x is entirely
plausible right now. All that's necessary is that tech executives stop thinking of
natural language processing as cutesy blue-sky research and start thinking in terms of
quarters-till-proﬁtability.
A concrete example is Waymo, which is raising $2bn investment rounds - and that's
for a technology with a much longer road to market.
Compute Cost
The other side of the equation is compute cost. The $5m GPT-3 training cost estimate
comes from using V100s at $10k/unit and 30 TFLOPS, which is the performance
without tensor cores being considered. Amortized over a year, this gives you about
$1000/PFLOPS-day.
However, this cost is driven up an order of magnitude by NVIDIA's monopolistic cloud
contracts, while performance will be higher when taking tensor cores into account.
The current hardware ﬂoor is nearer to the RTX 2080 TI's $1k/unit for 125 tensor-core
TFLOPS, and that gives you $25/PFLOPS-day. This roughly aligns with AI Impacts'
current estimates, and oﬀers another >10x speedup to our model.

I strongly suspect other bottlenecks stop you from hitting that kind of eﬃciency or
GPT-3 would've happened much sooner, but I still think $25/PFLOPS-day is a lower
useful bound.
Other Constraints
I've focused on money so far because most of the current 3.5-month doubling times
come from increasing investment. But money aside, there are a couple of other things
that could prove to be the binding constraint.
Scaling law breakdown. The GPT series' scaling is expected to break down
around 10k pﬂops-days (§6.3), which is a long way short of the amount of cash
on the table.
This could be because the scaling analysis was done on 1024-token
sequences. Maybe longer sequences can go further. More likely I'm
misunderstanding something.
Sequence length. GPT-3 uses 2048 tokens at a time, and that's with an
eﬃcient encoding that cripples it on many tasks. With the naive architecture,
increasing the sequence length is quadratically expensive, and getting up to
novel-length sequences is not very likely.
But there are a lot of plausible ways to ﬁx that, and complexity is no bar AI.
This constraint might plausibly not be resolved on a timescale of months,
however.
Data availability. From the same paper as the previous point, dataset size
rises with the square-root of compute; a 1000x larger GPT-3 would want 10
trillion tokens of training data.
It's hard to ﬁnd a good estimate on total-words-ever-written, but our library
of 130m books alone would exceed 10tn words. Considering books are a
small fraction of our textual output nowadays, it shouldn't be diﬃcult to
gather suﬃcient data into one spot once you've decided it's a useful thing.
So I'd be surprised if this was binding.
Bandwidth and latency. Networking 500 V100 together is one challenge, but
networking 500k V100s is another entirely.
I don't know enough about distributed training to say whether this is a very
sensible constraint or a very dumb one. I think it has a chance of being a
serious problem, but I think it's also the kind of thing you can design
algorithms around. Validating such algorithms might take more than a
timescale of months however.
Hardware availability. From the estimates above there are about 500 GPU-
years in GPT-3, or - based on a one-year training window - $5m worth of V100s
at $10k/piece. This is about 1% of NVIDIA's quarterly datacenter sales. A 100x
scale-up by multiple companies could saturate this supply.
This constraint can obviously be loosened by increasing production, but it'd
be hard to on a timescale of months.
Commoditization. If many companies go for huge NLP models, the proﬁt each
company can extract is driven towards zero. Unlike with other capex-heavy
research - like pharma - there's no IP protection for trained models. If you expect
proﬁt to be marginal, you're less likely to drop $1bn on your own training
program.
I am skeptical of this being an important factor while there are lots of
legacy, human-driven systems to replace. Replacing those systems should
be more than enough incentive to fund many companies' research

programs. Longer term, the eﬀects of commoditization might become
more important.
Inference costs. The GPT-3 paper (§6.3), gives .4kWh/100 pages of output,
which works out to 500 pages/dollar from eyeballing hardware cost as 5x
electricity. Scaling up 1000x and you're at $2/page, which is cheap compared to
humans but no longer quite as easy to experiment with.
I'm skeptical of this being a binding constraint. $2/page is still very cheap.
Beyond 1000x
Here we go from just pointing at big numbers and onto straight-up theorycrafting.
In all, tech investment as it is today plausibly supports another 100x-1000x scale up
in the very-near-term. If we get to 1000x - 1 ZFLOPS-day per model, $1bn per model -
then there are a few paths open.
I think the key question is if by 1000x, a GPT successor is obviously superior to
humans over a wide range of economic activities. If it is - and I think it's plausible that
it will be - then further investment will arrive through the usual market mechanisms,
until the largest models are being allocated a substantial fraction of global GDP.
On paper that leaves room for another 1000x scale-up as it reaches up to $1tn,
though current market mechanisms aren't really capable of that scale of investment.
Left to the market as-is, I think commoditization would kick in as the binding
constraint.
That's from the perspective of the market today though. Transformative AI might
enable $100tn-market-cap companies, or nation-states could pick up the torch. The
Apollo Program made for a $1tn-today share of GDP, so this degree of public
investment is possible in principle.
The even more extreme path is if by 1000x you've got something that can design
better algorithms and better hardware. Then I think we're in the hands of Christiano's
slow takeoﬀ four-year-GDP-doubling.
That's all assuming performance continues to improve, though. If by 1000x the model
is not obviously a challenger to human supremacy, then things will hopefully slow
down to ye olde fashioned 2010s-Moore's-Law rates of progress and we can rest safe
in the arms of something that's merely HyperGoogle.

Limits of Current US Prediction
Markets (PredictIt Case Study)
(Disclaimers: I work in the ﬁnancial industry, though not in a way related to prediction
markets. Anything I write here is my opinion and not that of my employer. 
This is a US-centric piece based on a case study of PredictIt: as some people have
pointed out in the comments below, if you are outside the US you may have
substantially better options.)

SECTION I: INTRODUCTION
So there's an argument that I've seen a lot over the past few years, particularly in LW-
adjacent circles, that goes something like this:
You say you believe X is likely to happen. But prediction markets say X is likely not
to happen. Since markets are eﬃcient, you must be wrong. Or if you do know
better than the market, why aren't you rich? Since you haven't bet on that market
to make free money, you must be lying. Or stupid. Or both!
This post is dedicated to disagreeing with that argument, not from an anti-Eﬃcient-
Market Hypothesis position, but from a pro-Eﬃcient-Market Hypothesis position. My
position is:
The argument above is pretty much sound if we are discussing mainstream
ﬁnancial markets. If someone claims to have better information than a
mainstream ﬁnancial market on the value of Google stock, or of copper, they
ought to either use this knowledge to make a huge amount of money or stop
talking about it. However, it is not true if we are discussing prediction markets.
Current prediction markets are so bad in so many diﬀerent ways that it simply
is not surprising for people to know better than them, and it often is not possible
for people to make money from knowing better.
I've been meaning to write this for a while, but got tipped over the edge by the recent
post here, which talks about the limitation of prediction markets being the correlation
of the events they predict to other assets, and their consequent value as hedging
instruments. That is...well...it's not wrong exactly, but there are so many other
problems that are so much bigger that I felt it was worth laying (some of) them out.
Math follows. I will be focusing on PredictIt for this analysis. Other prediction markets
may work a bit diﬀerently, but similar analysis is applicable to any of them. If you
think the math is wrong I am happy to discuss/make changes, but I very much doubt
any changes will materially alter the ﬁnal message.
As of this writing PredictIt has Donald Trump at 40% to win the election (or, to put it
another way, you can pay 40 cents for a share that pays out $1 if Trump wins).
Suppose you think he is more/less likely to win. How likely/unlikely does it need to be
for Trump to win for you to make money (in expectation)? Or, to put it another way,
what range of probabilities for Trump to win are consistent with the prediction market
values?

SECTION II: REASONABLY SIMPLE PROBLEMS
1: Spread.
This is only a small problem, but it is non-zero. PredictIt will sell me 'Donald Trump
wins' shares for 40 cents, but will sell me 'Donald Trump loses' shares for 61 cents
(which, from a ﬁnance perspective, works out very similarly to letting me sell 'Donald
Trump wins' shares for 39 cents). So if I think there is a 39.5% chance of Trump
winning, there is no way for me to make money oﬀ of it: I can buy 'Trump wins' shares
for 40 cents, or sell them for 39 cents, and if the true value is 39.5 cents both of these
will lose me money.
The range of possible probabilities for which you cannot make money starts at 39-
40%.
2: Transaction Fees.
PredictIt charges a 10% fee on proﬁts (see https://www.predictit.org/support/how-to-
trade-on-predictit). As far as I can tell, it does not net proﬁts against losses before
calculating these fees. That is to say, if I make two $100 bets at even odds, win one,
and lose the other, PredictIt will charge me a $10 fee on my winnings on the bet I won,
even though overall I have made no money.
So if I think there is a 50% chance of Trump winning, and spend $100 buying Trump
Wins shares, instead of my expected ﬁnal money being 50% * $250 = $125 for a $25
proﬁt, my expected ﬁnal money is 50% * ( $250 - $15 ) = $117.5 for a $17.50 proﬁt.
After accounting for this, the range of possible probabilities for which you cannot
make money is:
  = 42.6
1 − 
  = 36.5
3: Withdrawal Fees.
When I actually attempt to withdraw my money from PredictIt, PredictIt charges an
additional 5% fee on the withdrawal, giving me only 95% of my money back. How
important this fee is to any given bet varies depending on how many bets I make on
PredictIt (if I am making multiple bets without withdrawing money the eﬀective impact
of the fee on any given bet is smaller), but for now let's assume that (like most
people) I do not have a PredictIt account and would need to create one to make this
bet, and then withdraw my winnings immediately afterwards. If so, my eﬀective
winnings shrink again as 5% of my money (not just my winnings, all the money I
deposited) disappears to PredictIt.
After accounting for this, the range of possible probabilities for which you cannot
make money is
100
( 
  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10
100
0.40
100
( 
  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10
100
0.61

  = 44.8
1 − 
  = 33.2
4: Investment Interest Rate/Time Value of Money.
The presidential election will not happen until November. Let us be generous and
assume that PredictIt settles bets immediately thereafter (though their page for the
bet states 'PredictIt may determine how and when to settle the market based on all
information available to PredictIt at the relevant time' and 'PredictIt's decisions and
determinations under this rule shall be at PredictIt's sole discretion and shall be ﬁnal').
It is currently July. That means it will be ~4 months until the bet resolves, during which
time your money will be tied up in PredictIt.
What else could you be doing with that money? Well, depending on who you are, you
could be getting reasonably risk-free returns via e.g. Treasuries or bank accounts, but
those interest rates are low. On the other hand, your bet is de facto a loan to
PredictIt as well as whatever bet you think you made. If PredictIt suddenly goes
bankrupt in a massive downturn, or if whoever runs it takes the money and ﬂees to
Dubai, you may not get paid back. So, what eﬀective interest rate would you charge
to loan PredictIt money in the current ﬁnancial environment? How risky an investment
is it? If you would charge it 5% per year (which I don't think is all that high by the
standards of bonds in risky companies), then over those 4 months you could have
made about 2% return without the prediction market involved.
(Side note: this eﬀect is larger or smaller depending on what event you are
considering and how far in the future it lies. There's some reason to expect that this
will make prediction markets a little more eﬃcient as the event they pertain to draws
closer, but there are still quite a few other problems).
After accounting for this, the range of possible probabilities for which you cannot
make money is:
  = 45.7
1 − 
  = 31.8
So at this point, the 40% probability we see for Trump to win on PredictIt is completely
compatible with any probability from 31.8%-45.7%. This is already...rather a wide
range. And this is before we encounter two rather larger issues:
100
0.95 ∗ ( 
  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10
100
0.40
100
0.95 ∗ ( ( 
  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10 )
100
0.61
100
0.98 ∗ 0.95 ∗ ( ( 
  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10 )
100
0.40
100
0.98 ∗ 0.95 ∗ ( ( 
  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10 )
100
0.61

SECTION III: HORRIBLE MESSY PROBLEMS
5: Taxes
Note: I am not a lawyer! I am particularly not a tax lawyer! This section is
speculative, even more US-centric than the rest of this piece, may well be
wrong, and even if it is right your tax situation may be diﬀerent!
As far as I can tell, PredictIt winnings are treated by the US government as income.
This means two things: ﬁrst, that if you win money on PredictIt the US government will
tax it; and second, that if you lose money on PredictIt the US government will not let
you net it against anything. So, just like PredictIt's fees did, taxes require you to have
a much higher chance of winning in order to be net-positive.
If you have a good accountant and think you can net PredictIt losses against another
tax bill, or avoid paying taxes on PredictIt winnings, this might not be applicable to
you.
If we assume you pay a 15% tax rate (according to Google this is pretty close to the
nationwide average), the range of possible probabilities for which you cannot make
money is:
  = 50.0
1 − 
  = 27.9
And if we assume you are paying 35% income tax (which requires a high salary, but I
suspect a lot of the people who we're hoping will come and correct the prediction
market for us have high salaries...) then the range of possible probabilities is:
  = 57.2
1 − 
  = 21.8
So now we're fully compatible with Trump being anywhere from below a one-in-four to
above a one-in-two chance! And then we encounter the really big one.

Part of how markets work is that people who know better will eventually be able to
command more of the money. If I am able to predict the price of Apple stock better
than anyone else, I can multiply my money faster, I can use my track record to get
other people to invest with me, and I can direct large quantities of money, which both
makes me a lot of money and allows me to move the market to a more accurate
valuation.
PredictIt places a limit of $800 on your position in any one bet.
At the market level, this means that you can no longer rely on small numbers of
intelligent people to ﬁx market prices for you. Since a small number of intelligent
people can only mobilize at most $800 each, you are reliant on lots of diﬀerent
people intelligently picking the right price.
And at the individual level, this makes it diﬃcult to make any amount of money that
matters oﬀ a prediction market.
In a real ﬁnancial market, people will invest large amounts of money. If a hedge fund
pays ten million dollars a year hiring dozens of smart people to discover a way of
making 1% excess return, so long as they are investing at least a billion dollars that is
worth it. Therefore, in a real ﬁnancial market, there is reason to expect that any
analysis that can correct market prices will be done, even if it is diﬃcult and
expensive to do.
PredictIt can just about manage to let people who can correct market prices make
enough money to merit creating an account there.
Recall that, even with zero taxes, the range of possible probabilities for which you
could not make money was:
  = 45.7
1 − 
  = 31.8
But this is the range of probabilities for which you cannot make any money at all.
Suppose that you think Trump's chance to win is 50%. If you invest the maximum
$800, you will end up with in expectation:
8 ∗ 0.5 ∗ 0.98 ∗ 0.95 ∗ ( ( 
  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10 ) = $ 875.14
which gives an expected proﬁt of about $75, and that was without considering taxes.
If you face a 35% tax rate, and think Trump's chance to win is literally zero, after
investing $800 you end up with:
8 ∗ 0.98 ∗ 0.95 ∗ ( ( 
  ∗ 0.9 ∗ 0.65 ) + 45 ) = $ 1049.44
100
0.98 ∗ 0.95 ∗ ( ( 
  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10 )
100

  ∗ 0.9 ) + 10 )
100
0.61
100
0.4
100
0.61

making a proﬁt of about $250 in exchange for knowing with absolute certainty
that an event a prediction market has at a 40% probability is guaranteed not
to happen.
This is not suﬃcient to merit dedicating time and eﬀort to research.

SECTION IV: CONCLUSION
If someone claims that they are absolutely certain Trump will/will not win the election,
they should be able to make money on a prediction market from this prediction.
However, they may not be able to make very much money at all, and even if they are
quite conﬁdent that the prediction market is wrong it may not be worth their time.
Assuming that this person should be willing to bet on their views on a prediction
market may be merited, but even from a purely ﬁnancial view it is a much closer aﬀair
than you may think.
If someone claims that Nate Silver and 538's analysis team know better than a
prediction market what Trump's odds of winning the election are, they are quite
likely correct. It is not possible with prediction markets in their current state for
them to make money from that knowledge. If you dismiss this person because they
haven't bet on prediction markets, you are actively wrong, you are making me and a
system I believe is a good idea look bad by association, and I would like you to stop
talking about this.

DARPA Digital Tutor: Four Months to
Total Technical Expertise?
DARPA spent a few million dollars around 2009 to create the world's best digital
tutoring system for IT workers in the Navy. I am going to explain their results, the
system itself, possible limitations, and where to go from here.
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single nerd having read Ender's Game
must be in want of the Fantasy Game. The great draw of the Fantasy Game is that the
game changes with the player and reﬂects the needs of the learner growing
dynamically with him/her. This dream of the student is best realized in the world of
tutoring, which while not as fun, is known to be very, very eﬀective. Individualized
instruction can make students jump to the 98 percentile compared to non tutored
students. DARPA poked at this idea with their Digital Tutor trying to answer this
question: How close to the expertise and knowledge base of well-experienced IT
experts can we get new recruits in 16 weeks using a digital tutoring system?
I will say the results upfront, but before I do, I want to do two things. First pause to
note the audacity of the project. Some project manager thought, "I bet we can design
a system for training that is as good as 5 years on the job experience." This is
astoundingly ambitious. I love it! Second a few caveats. Caveat 1) Don't be confused.
Technical training is not the same as education. The goals in education are not merely
to learn some technical skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic. Getting any system
to usefully measure things like inculturation, citizenship, moral uprightness, and social
mores is not yet something any system can do, let alone a digital system. Caveat 2)
Online classes have notoriously high attrition rates, drop rates, and no shows. Caveat
3) Going in we should not expect the digital tutor to be as good as a human tutor. A
human tutor likely can catch nuances that a digital tutor, no matter how good cannot.
Caveat 4) Language processing technology, chat bots, and AI systems are signiﬁcantly
better in 2020 than they were 2009, so we should be forgiving if the DARPA IT
program is not as good as it would be if the experiment were rerun today.
All these caveats, I think should give us a reason to adjust our mental score of the
Digital Tutor a few clicks upward and give it some credit. However, this charitable read
of the Digital Tutor that I started with when reading the paper turned out to be
unnecessary. The Digital Tutor students outperformed traditionally taught students
and ﬁeld experts in solving IT problems on the ﬁnal assessment. They did not merely
meet the goal of being as good after 16 weeks as experts in the ﬁeld, but they
actually outperformed them. This is a ridiculously positive outcome, and we need to
look closely to see what parts of this story are believable and make some conjectures
for why this happened and some bets about whether it will replicate.
The Digital Tutor Experience
We will start with the Digital Tutor student experience. This will give us the context we
need to understand the results.
Students (cadets?) were on the same campus and in classrooms with their computers
which ran the Digital Tutor program. A uniformed Naval oﬃcer proctored each day for
their 16 week course. The last 'period' of the day was a study hall with occasional
hands-on practice sessions led by the Naval oﬃcer. This set-up is important for a few

reasons, in my opinion. There is a shared experience among the students of working
on IT training, plus the added accountability of a proctor keeps everyone on task. This
social aspect is very important and powerful compared to the dissipation experienced
by the lone laborer at home on the computer. This social structure completely
counteracts caveat 2 above. The Digital Tutor is embedded in a social world where the
students are not given the same level of freedom to fail that a Coursera class oﬀers.
Unlike many learning systems, the Digital Tutor had no ﬁnishing early option. Students
had on average one week to complete a module, but the module would continuously
teach, challenge, and assess for students who reached the ﬁrst benchmark. "Fast-
paced learners who reached targeted levels of learning early were given more diﬃcult
problems, problems that dealt with related subtopics that were not otherwise
presented in the time available, problems calling for higher levels of understanding
and abstraction, or challenge problems with minimal (if any) tutorial assistance." Thus
the ceiling was very high and kept the high ﬂyers engaged.
As for pedagogical method "[The Digital Tutor] presents conceptual material followed
by problems that apply the concepts and are intended to be as authentic,
comprehensive, and epiphanic as those obtained from years of IT experience in the
Fleet. Once the learner demonstrates suﬃcient understanding of the material
presented and can explain and apply it successfully, the Digital Tutor advances either
vertically, to the next higher level of conceptual abstraction in the topic area, or
horizontally, to new but related topic areas." Assessment of the students throughout
is done by the Conversation Module in the DT which oﬀers hints, asks leading
questions, and requests clariﬁcations of the student's reasoning. If there is a problem
or hangup, the Digital Tutor will summon the human proctor to come help (the paper
does not give any indication of how often this happened).
At the end of the 16 weeks, the students trained by the Digital Tutor squared oﬀ in a
three way two week assessment comparing them to a group which was trained in a 35
week classroom program and experienced Fleet technicians. Those trained by the
Digital Tutor signiﬁcantly outperformed both groups.
At least four patterns were repeated across the diﬀerent performance measures:
With the exception of the Security exercise, Digital Tutor participants
outperformed the Fleet and ITTC participants on all other tests.
Diﬀerences between Fleet and ITTC participants were generally smaller and
neither consistently positive nor negative.
On the Troubleshooting exercises, which closely resemble Navy duty station
work, Digital Tutor teams substantially outscored Fleet ITs and ITTC graduates,
with higher scores at every diﬃculty level, less harm to the system, and fewer
unnecessary steps.
In individual tests of IT knowledge, Digital Tutor graduates also substantially
outscored Fleet ITs and ITTC graduates.
How did they build the Digital Tutor?
This process was long, arduous, and expensive. First they recruited subject area
experts and had them do example tutoring sessions. They took the best tutors from
among the subject area experts and had 24 of them tutor students one-on-one in their
sub-domain of expertise. Those students essentially received a one-on-one 16 week
course. Those sessions were all recorded and served as the template for the Digital
Tutor.

A content author (usually a tutor) and content engineer would work together to create
the module for each sub-domain while a course architect oversaw the whole course
and made sure everything ﬁt together.
The Digital Tutor itself has four layers: 1) a framework for the IT ontologies and feature
extraction, 2) an Inference Engine to judge the students
understanding/misunderstanding, 3) an Instruction Engine to decide what
topics/problems to serve up next, a Conversation Module which uses natural language
to prod the student to think through the problem and create tests for their
understanding, and 4) a Recommender to call in a human tutor when necessary.
I would like to know a lot more about this, so if anyone could point me in a good
direction to learn how to eﬃciently do some basic Knowledge Engineering that would
be much appreciated.
So in terms of personnel we are talking 24 tutors, about 6 content authors, a team of
AI engineers, several iterations through each module with test cohorts, and several
proctors throughout the course, and maybe a few extra people to set up the virtual
and physical problem conﬁgurations. Given this expense and eﬀort, it will not be an
easy task to try and replicate their results in a separate domain or even the same one.
One note in the paper that I found obscure is that the paper claimed the Direct Tutor
"is, at present, expensive to use for instruction." What does this mean? Once the thing
is built, besides the tutors/teachers - which you would need for any course of study,
what makes it expensive at present? I'm deﬁnitely confused here.
Digging into the results
The assessment of the 3 groups in seven categories showed the superiority of the
Digital Tutoring system in everything but Security. For whatever reason they could not
get a tutor to be part of the development of the Security module, so that module was
mostly lecture. Interestingly though, if we were to assume all else to be equal, then
this hole in the Digital Tutor program serves to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the
program design through a via negativa.
In any case the breakdown of performance in the seven categories, I think is pretty
well captured in the Troubleshooting assessment.
"Digital Tutor teams attempted a total of 140 problems and successfully solved 104 of
them (74%), with an average score of 3.78 (1.91). Fleet teams attempted 100
problems and successfully solved 52 (52%) of them, with an average score of 2.00
(2.26). ITTC teams attempted 87 problems and successfully solved 33 (38%) of them,
with an average score of 1.41 (2.09)."
Similar eﬀects are true across the board, but that is not what interests me exactly,
because I want to know about question type. Indeed, what makes this study so eye
catching is that it is NOT a spaced-repetition-is-the-answer-to-life paper in disguise
(yes, spaced-repetition is the bomb, but I contend that MOST of what we want to
accomplish in education can't be reinforced by spaced-repetition, but oh hell, is it
good for language acquisition!).
The program required students to employ complicated concepts and procedures that
were more than could be captured by a spaced-repetition program. "Exercises in each
IT subarea evolve from a few minutes and a few steps to open-ended 30-40 minute
problems." (I wonder what the time-required distribution is for real life IT problems for
experts?) So this is really impressive! The program is asking students and experienced

Fleet techs to learn how to solve large actual problems aboard ships and is successful
on that score. We should be getting really excited about this! Remember in 16 weeks
these folks were made into experts.
Well let's consider another possibility... what if IT system network maintenance is a
skill set that is, frankly, not that hard? You can do this for IT, but not for Captains of a
ship, Admirals of a ﬂeet, or Program Managers in DARPA. Running with this argument a
little more, perhaps the abstract reasoning and conceptual problem solving in IT is
related to the lower level spaced-repetition skills in a way that for administrators,
historians, and writers it is not. The inferential leap, in other words, from the basics to
expert X-Ray vision of problems is lower in IT than in other professional settings.
Perhaps. And I think this argument has merit to it. But I also think this is one of those
examples of raising the bar for what "true expertise" is, because the old bar has been
reached. To me, it is totally fair to say that some IT problems do require creative
thinking and a fully functional understanding of a system to solve. That the students
of the Direct Tutor (and its human adjuncts) outperformed the experts on unnecessary
steps and avoided causing more problems than they ﬁxed is some strong evidence
that this program opened the door to new horizons.
Where to go from here
From here I would like to learn more about how to create AI systems like this and try it
out with the ﬁrst chapter of AoPS Geometry. I could test this in a school context
against a control group and see what happens.
Eventually, I would like to see if something like this could work for AP European
History and research and writing. I want someone to start pushing these program
strategies into the social sciences, humanities and other soft ﬁelds, like politics
(elected members to government could have an intensive course so they don't screw
everything up immediately).
Another thing I would be interested to see is a better platform for making these AI
networks. Since creating something of this sort can only be done by expert
programmers, content knowledge experts can't gather together to create their own
Digital Tutors. This is a huge bottleneck. If we could put a software suite together that
was only moderately more easy than the current diﬃculty of creating a fully
operational knowledge environment from scratch that could have an outsized eﬀect
on education within a few years.

Thiel on Progress and Stagnation
This is a linkpost for
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zao_AyBhNb8TPWrQqgXn5NzNAgfEqzTIaFYos7w
dqGI/edit?usp=sharing
Peter Thiel is one of the most exciting and original thinkers of our era, but many of his
opinions are scattered across a range of talks and articles. So Jeremy Nixon and I have
put together an organised presentation of his views on progress and stagnation, in his
own words. The full document, which is a little over 100 pages, is here; below I've
listed some of his key quotes.
While I don't agree with all of his opinions, I've found many of them very insightful and
valuable. I'm particularly interested in understanding how to reconcile his views on
stagnation with the sort of accelerationist view of technological progress portrayed
here and elsewhere.
Key quotes:
When tracked against the admittedly lofty hopes of the 1950s and 1960s,
technological progress has fallen short in many domains.
When we talk about how fast science is progressing, we do it with little precision.
Are we accelerating in scientiﬁc and technical ﬁelds? How fast is this? In
response, we get fairly vague answers. I would submit that the consensus in
both a Silicon Valley and academic context is that we are doing great and that
everything is just moving super fast. All these forms of accelerations. And we
can debate whether it's utopian - Kurzweil with the singularity is near, where all
you need to do is sit back and eat some popcorn and watch the movie of the
future unfold, or this dystopia, all the science ﬁction movies from Hollywood and
all the robots will kill you, or you'll be in this matrix - we're either accelerating to
utopia or accelerating to dystopia. The somewhat contrarian thesis I have on this
is that perhaps the progress is not as fast as advertised. Things have been
slower and have been slower for quite some time.
The single most important economic development in recent times has been the
broad stagnation of real wages and incomes since 1973, the year when oil prices
quadrupled. To a ﬁrst approximation, the progress in computers and the failure
in energy appear to have roughly canceled each other out. Like Alice in the Red
Queen's race, we (and our computers) have been forced to run faster and faster
to stay in the same place.
Probably the only engineering ﬁelds that are doing really well are computer
science and maybe, at this point, petroleum engineering. And most other areas
of engineering have been bad career decisions the last 40 years ... Nuclear
engineering, aerospace engineering, were really catastrophic decisions for very
talented people to go into. So even though rhetorically we always say that we
want more science and engineering people, in practice, these have been
extremely tough ﬁelds.
You could say that all these gadgets and devices, they dazzle us but they also
distract us from the ways in which our larger surroundings are strangely old. So
we run cell phones while we're riding in a 19th-century subway system in New

York. San Francisco, the housing stock looks like it's from the 50s and 60s, it's
mostly quite decrepit and incredibly hard to change these sort of things. So you
have bits making progress, atoms are strangely very stuck.
On our website, we have this tagline - "They promised us ﬂying cars and all we
got was 140 characters." Which is a little bit of a dig at Twitter. But in some
sense Twitter is probably a great business. The thousand people who work at
Twitter are going to have well-paying jobs. I suspect it will last for decades. It's
probably not enough to take our civilization to the next level. But again it's a
mistake to blame Twitter for that. It's more a problem with not enough
happening elsewhere.
The story of speciﬁc success that masks generalized failure is one we ﬁnd very
hard to tell.
We live in a world where we've been working on the Star Trek computer in
Silicon Valley, but we don't have anything else from Star Trek. We don't have the
warp drive, we don't have the transporter, we can't re-engineer matter in this
cornucopian world where there is no scarcity. And how good is a society where
you have a well-functioning Star Trek computer, but nothing else from Star Trek?
If we have runaway automation, and if we're building robots that are smarter
than humans and can do everything humans can do, then we probably have to
have a serious conversation about a universal basic income or something like
that, and you're going to end up with a very, very weird society. I don't see the
automation happening at all, and I think the question of automation in my mind
is identical to this question of productivity growth.
I would be very uncomfortable starting with the social programs without the
growth. That's the sort of conversation that I often see happening in Silicon
Valley, where we start with UBI, because we're lying about automation. If
automation's happening, then we'll see in the productivity numbers, and then
eventually, maybe we need something like UBI. If automation is not happening
and you do UBI, then you just blow up the economy.
There have been periods of globalization and technology in the last two
centuries, and they're not synonymous. The 19th century, I think you had both.
You had enormous globalization, enormous amounts of technological process,
1815 to 1914.
By 1971, Kissinger's trip to China, is the point where I would say globalization
starts again very much in earnest. But I think we've had, for much of the last 40
years, a somewhat more limited technological process, where the word
technology has been narrowed to information technology. In the 50s and 60s,
technology meant many other things. It meant biotech, medical devices. It
meant nuclear power, new forms of energy, underwater cities, the green
revolution in agriculture, space travel, supersonic aviation, ﬂying cars, etc., etc.
So there has been—so I would argue that the 19th century had both—the last
100 years had a period of technology without globalization, and then more
recently, a period of globalization with somewhat more limited technological
progress. A lot in computers and the world of bits. Not so much in the world of
atoms.
If you ask "Why did all the rocket scientists go to work on Wall Street in the '90s
to create new ﬁnancial products?" and you say they were paid too much in

ﬁnance and we need to beat up on the ﬁnance industry, that seems like that's
the wrong side to focus on. I think the answer was they couldn't get jobs as
rocket scientists any more because you couldn't build rockets or supersonic
airplanes or anything like that. It's like, why did brilliant people in the Soviet
Union become grandmaster chess players? It's not that there's anything deeply
wrong with chess. It's that they weren't allowed to do anything else.
I think money and the nature of money is somehow much less important than all
the microregulations that make up the economy. If you give me a choice of
getting rid of the vast bulk of government regulations and keeping the Fed, I'd
much rather do that than keeping all the other zoning laws and crazy rules we
have and going with PayPal, Bitcoin, gold, any sort of alternate currency one
could come up with.
Most of our political leaders are not engineers or scientists and do not listen to
engineers or scientists. Today a letter from Einstein would get lost in the White
House mail room, and the Manhattan Project would not even get started; it
certainly could never be completed in three years.
This is a disturbing element in the history of innovation: A lot of innovators
discovered things, but weren't able to get anything. Tesla was out-competed by
Edison, even though Edison had an inferior technology. The Wright brothers
came up with the ﬁrst airplane, but they didn't get to be rich. Of course, in the
sciences, it tends to be even worse. If you are Einstein, you come up with
general relativity. You don't get to be a billionaire; you don't even get to be a
millionaire. It's always this question of how do you actually capture some of the
value of what you create.
Name me one science ﬁction ﬁlm that Hollywood produced in the last 25 years
in which technology is portrayed in a positive light, in which it's not dystopian, it
doesn't kill people, it doesn't destroy the world, it doesn't not work, etc., etc.
Instead, we have one sort of catastrophic, anti-technological scenario after
another, and the future is some combination of the Terminator movie, and
Avatar, and Elysium, and you know, The Matrix. I watched the Gravity movie the
other day. You would never want to go into outer space. I mean, you want to be
back on a muddy island somewhere on this planet. And again, I think Hollywood
is not the sole source of this. To some extent, it mostly just reﬂects the broader
culture, which I think at this point, is very anti-technological. Which is why I think
Silicon Valley is sort of the center of the counterculture in our society today.
Indeﬁnite attitudes to the future explain what's most dysfunctional in our world
today. Process trumps substance: when people lack concrete plans to carry out,
they use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various options. This describes
Americans today. In middle school, we're encouraged to start hoarding
"extracurricular activities." In high school, ambitious students compete even
harder to appear omnicompetent. By the time a student gets to college, he's
spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a
completely unknowable future. Come what may, he's ready—for nothing in
particular. A deﬁnite view, by contrast, favors ﬁrm convictions. Instead of
pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it "well-roundedness," a deﬁnite
person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working
tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something
substantive—to be a monopoly of one. This is not what young people do today,
because everyone around them has long since lost faith in a deﬁnite world. No

one gets into Stanford by excelling at just one thing, unless that thing happens
to involve throwing or catching a leather ball.
In a deﬁnite world money is a means to an end because there are speciﬁc things
you want to do with money. In an indeﬁnite world you have no idea what to do
with money and money simply becomes an end in itself, which seems always a
little bit perverse. You just accumulate money and you have no idea what to do
with it. You have no idea because nobody knows what to do with anything and so
you give the money to a large bank to help you do something. What does the
bank do? It has no idea so it gives the money to a portfolio of institutional
investors. What does each institutional investor do? They have no idea and so
they all just invest in a portfolio of stocks. Not too much in any single stock ever
because that suggests you have opinions or you have ideas and that's very
dangerous, because it suggests that you're somehow not with it. And then what
do the companies do that get the money? They've been told that all they should
do is generate free cash ﬂows because if they were to actually invest the money
in speciﬁc things that would suggest the companies had ideas about the future,
and that would be very dangerous.
I think there is a big hysteresis part to this where success begets success and
then failure begets failure, where if you haven't had any major successes in a
number of decades, it does induce a certain amount of learned helplessness,
and then it shifts the way science gets done or the way innovation gets done in
to a more bureaucratic, political structure where the people who get the
research grants are more the politicians than the scientists. You're rewarded for
very small incremental progress, not for trying to take risks. It's led over time to
a more incrementalist, egalitarian, risk-adverse approach, which I think has not
worked all that well.
There's this very strange aspect in Silicon Valley where so many of the very
successful entrepreneurs and innovators seem to be suﬀering from a mild form
of Asperger's or something like this. I always wonder whether this needs to be
turned around into a critique of our society where if you don't suﬀer Asperger's,
you get too distracted by the people around you. They tell you things, you listen
to them, and somehow the wisdom of crowds is generally wrong.
Competition makes us better at that which we're competing on, but it narrows
our focus to beating the people around us. It distracts us from things that are
more valuable or more important or more meaningful.
What I think people like Zuckerburg or Musk or Jeﬀ Bezos at Amazon have in
common is that they're relentless. They don't stop. Every day, they start over,
do more, get better at it. People often ask whether Facebook was just a ﬂuke, in
the right place at the right time. But I think the more you get to know Mark or
founders like him, the less plausible it becomes. And that's, in part, because you
can see how hard he works, how much planning it was, how much of a vision
there was from the very beginning.
I'm very sympathetic to this distraction theory that what's going on in our
society is like a psychosocial, magic, hypnotic magic trick where we're being
distracted from something very important and political correctness, identity
politics and maybe American exceptionalism, these various ideological systems,
are distracting us from things. The thing I keep thinking of, the main thing it's

distracting us from, is the stagnation and it's that there are these problems that
we don't want to talk about in our society.
The ﬁrst and the hardest step is to see that we now ﬁnd ourselves in a desert,
and not in an enchanted forest.
My suspicion is that these are the ever-narrower communities of sub-experts,
the string theorists, the cancer researchers, telling us how great the string
theorists and the cancer researchers respectively are. It's a place where there's
no outside check, no reality check, no ability to really keep score, and you are
certainly not exceptional and you're not even great.
If you're a professor in academia, [you say]: the tenure system is great. It's just
picking the most talented people. I don't think it's that hard at all. It's completely
meritocratic. And if you don't say those things, well we know you're not the
person to get tenure. So I think there's this individual incentive where if you
pretend the system is working, you're simultaneously signaling that you're one
of the few people who should succeed in it.
The future of technology is not predetermined, and we must resist the
temptation of technological utopianism — the notion that technology has a
momentum or will of its own, that it will guarantee a more free future, and
therefore that we can ignore the terrible arc of the political in our world.
A better metaphor is that we are in a deadly race between politics and
technology. The future will be much better or much worse, but the question of
the future remains very open indeed. We do not know exactly how close this
race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the
world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of individuals may still be
paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the eﬀort of a single person
who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe
for capitalism.
There's nothing automatic about history. History is made up by the choices
people make and it's in our hands to decide.
If you deﬁne technology as doing more with less, education is perhaps the most
anti-technological aspect of our society today where you're getting the same at
a higher and higher price. The real costs of higher education since 1980 have
gone up about 400 percent, that's after inﬂation. And it's not clear the quality
has gone up at all.
If you come back to something as reductionist as the ever escalating student
debt, you can think: what is the 1.6 trillion, what does it pay for? And in a sense,
it pays for $1.6 trillion worth of lies about how great the system is.
I don't like the word education because it is such an extraordinary abstraction.
I'm very much in favor of learning. I'm much more skeptical of credentialing or
the abstraction called education. So there are all of these granular questions like
what is it that we're learning? Why are you learning it? Are you going to college
because it's a four year party? Is it a consumption decision? Is it an investment
decision where you're investing in your future? Is it insurance? Or is it a
tournament where you're just beating other people?

One of my friends suggested that we were at a point in education that's like the
place where the Catholic Church was on the eve of the reformation. It had
become a very corrupt institution. It was charging more and more for
indulgences. People thought they could only get saved by going to Catholic
Church just like people today believe that salvation involves getting a college
diploma. And if you don't get a college diploma that you're going to go to hell. I
think my answer is, in some ways, like that of the formers in the 16th century. It
is the same disturbing answer that you're going to have to ﬁgure out your
salvation on your own.
I believe they are inducing two perspectives on China in the West. One
perspective is that China is very far behind us, that it's still a very poor
backward country. Even in 2049, even on the 100-year anniversary, it will still
only be a middle-income country, and it's so far behind that we don't need to
worry about it and we can be in denial about China. And the other one is that it's
so far ahead of us that there is no way that we can ever catch up. It works
better, it can build skyscrapers super fast, it works so much better that we have
to just accept that we are really far behind. Denial is extreme optimism,
acceptance is extreme pessimism, but extreme optimism and extreme
pessimism converge to doing nothing.

Six economics misconceptions of mine
which I've resolved over the last few
years
Here are six cases where I was pretty conﬁdent in my understanding of the
microeconomics of something, but then later found out I was missing an important
consideration.
Thanks to Richard Ngo and Tristan Hume for helpful comments.
Here's the list of mistakes:
I thought divesting from a company had no eﬀect on the company.
I thought that the prices on a prediction market converged to the probabilities of
the underlying event.
I thought that I shouldn't expect to be able to make better investment decisions
than buying index funds.
I had a bad understanding of externalities, which was improved by learning
about Coase's theorem.
I didn't realize that regulations like minimum wages are analogous to taxes in
that they disincentivize work.
I misunderstood the economics of price controls.
In each, I'm not talking about empirical situations at all—I'm just saying that I had a
theoretical analysis which I think turned out to be wrong. It's possible that in many
real situations, the additional considerations I've learned about don't actually aﬀect
the outcome very much. But it was still an error to not know that those considerations
were potentially relevant.
1. Divestment
I used to believe that personally divesting in a company didn't aﬀect its share price,
and therefore had no impact on the company. I guess my reasoning here was
something like "If the share is worth $10 and you sell it, someone else will just buy it
for $10, so the price won't change". I was treating shares as if they were worth some
ﬁxed amount of money.
The simplest explanation for why you can't just model shares as being worth ﬁxed
amounts of money is that people are risk averse, and so the tenth Google share you
buy is worth less to you than the ﬁrst; and so as the price decreases, it becomes more
worthwhile to take a bigger risk on the company.
As a result, divestment reduces the price of shares, in the same way that selling
anything else reduces its price.
In the speciﬁc case of divestment, this means that when I sell some stocks, the price
ends up lower than it was.

I ﬁrst learned I was wrong about this from this Sideways View post, published May
2019.
2. Index funds
I used to think that it wasn't possible for individuals like me to get higher returns than
I'd get from just buying an index fund, because in an eﬃcient market, every share is
equally valuable.
This is wrong for a few reasons. One is that the prices of shares are determined by the
risk aversion of other market participants; if your risk aversion is diﬀerent from the
average, some shares (speciﬁcally, risky ones) will be much better investments than
others.
Secondly, because I'm risk averse, I prefer buying shares which are going to do
relatively well in worlds where I'm relatively poorer. For example, if I'm a software
engineer at a tech company, compared to a random shareholder I should invest more
in companies which are as anticorrelated with software engineer salaries as possible.
Or if I live in the US, I should consider investing in the markets of other countries.
I didn't understand this fully until around April this year.
3. Prediction markets
Relatedly, I thought that the fair market price of a contract which pays out $1 if Trump
gets elected is just the probability of Trump getting elected. This is wrong because
Trump getting elected is correlated with how valuable other assets are. Suppose I
thought that Trump has a 50% chance of getting reelected, and that if he gets re-
elected, the stock market will crash. If I have a bunch of my money in the stock
market, the contract is worth more than 50 cents, because it hedges against Trump
winning.
(Here's a maybe more intuitive way of seeing this: Suppose I could pick between
getting $10 in the world where Trump won (in which we're assuming the market would
crash) and the world where Trump lost. Clearly the $10 would be more valuable to me
in the world where he wins and my stocks are decimated. So the value of the "Trump
wins" contract is higher than the value of the "Trump loses" contract, even though
they correspond to events of equal probability.) And there is a potentially very high
number of correlative outcomes that betters might be thinking about and hedging
against, and the market computes these and reﬂects them in the price.
This is a more general version of the point that it's hard to have a prediction market
on whether the world will end. Paul Christiano has an old blog post on this topic which
I ﬁrst saw years ago but which I didn't understand properly at the time.
I ﬁrst understood this fully around March this year.
All of these ﬁrst three mistakes were the result of me not really understanding basic
portfolio theory; thanks to spending a bunch of time talking to traders over the last
few years, I now understand it better.

4. Coase's arguments about externalities
I used to have an overly simplistic picture of externalities—I believed the Econ 101
story: normally markets are eﬃcient, but when a good has an externality the wrong
amount will be produced, and this is resolved by putting a tax or subsidy on the good
to internalize the externality.
I changed my mind about this after reading David Friedman's essay. I'll just quote a
few paragraphs:
The ﬁrst step is to realize that an external cost is not simply a cost produced by
the pollutor and born by the victim. In almost all cases, the cost is a result of
decisions by both parties. I would not be coughing if your steel mill were not
pouring out sulfur dioxide. But your steel mill would do no damage to me if I did
not happen to live down wind from it. It is the joint decision—yours to pollute and
mine to live where you are polluting—that produces the cost.
Suppose that, in a particular case, the pollution does $100,000 a year worth of
damage and can be eliminated at a cost of only $80,000 a year (from here on, all
costs are per year). Further assume that the cost of shifting all of the land down
wind to a new use unaﬀected by the pollution—growing timber instead of renting
out summer resorts, say—is only $50,000. If we impose an emission fee of a
hundred thousand dollars a year, the steel mill stops polluting and the damage is
eliminated—at a cost of $80,000. If we impose no emission fee the mill keeps
polluting, the owners of the land stop advertising for tenants and plant trees
instead, and the problem is again solved—at a cost of $50,000. In this case the
result without Pigouvian taxes is eﬃcient—the problem is eliminated at the lowest
possible cost—and the result with Pigouvian taxes in ineﬃcient.
Moving the victims may not be a very plausible solution in the case of air
pollution; it seems fairly certain that even the most draconian limitations on
emissions in southern California would be less expensive than evacuating that end
of the state. But the problem of externalities applies to a wide range of diﬀerent
situations, in many of which it is far from obvious which party can avoid the
problem at lower cost and in some of which it is not even obvious which one we
should call the victim.
My previous position was missing this nuance. I ﬁrst read that David Friedman essay
midway through last year.
5. Non-tax regulations that increase equality
have disincentive eﬀects on work
I used to think that the way to decide whether a minimum wage was good was to look
at the eﬀect on unemployment and the eﬀect on total income for minimum wage
workers, and then ﬁgure out whether I thought that the increase in unemployment
was worth the increase in income. I think this was wrong in two pretty diﬀerent ways.
The ﬁrst mistake is that I was neglecting the fact that policies aimed at transferring
wealth from rich people to poor people disincentivize making money. Taxes are just a
special case of this, and can be seen as part of a category of wealth-transferal policies
that includes minimum wage. So when you're arguing that a minimum wage would be

part of the optimal policy portfolio, you have to argue that it would be better than a
tax. I did not understand that this was part of the calculation.
I ﬁrst learned this from a post by Paul Christiano which I think he incorporated into
Objection 2 here; that blog post was published March 2019.
6. Price and quality controls
The second of the ways I was wrong about the minimum wage comes from a
misunderstanding of the economics of price controls; in hindsight I think that my high
school economics curriculum was just wrong about this. I think that I realized my
misconception after reading The Dark Lord's Answer, published in 2016.
In high school economics, I was taught that when the government imposes a price
ﬂoor (e.g., a minimum wage), you'll end up with more supply than demand for the
good. This is beneﬁcial to suppliers who still succeed at selling the good, it's harmful
to suppliers who can no longer sell the good, and it's harmful to buyers.
I now think that that understanding was overly simplistic. Here's my current
understanding.
In a market, the supply and demand of a good must equilibrate somehow—for every
loaf of bread that someone buys, someone had to sell a loaf of bread. One way that
the market can equilibrate is that the price can change—if the price is higher, selling
is more attractive and buying is less attractive. So if more people want to buy than
sell at the current price, we might expect the price to rise until things are in
equilibrium.
But there are other variables than price which can change in a way that allow the
market to equilibrate. One obvious example is product quality—if you decrease the
quality of a product, consumers are less enthusiastic about buying but suppliers are
more enthusiastic about selling (because they can presumably make it for cheaper).
Often, ﬂuctuations in quality rather than price are what cause markets to equilibrate.
For example, restaurants often don't have price hikes at busy times, they just have
long waits. Customers like it less when they have to wait more, and restaurants like
having customers waiting (because it helps them ensure that their restaurant is
constantly full).
So when we talk about the equilibrium state of a market, we can't just talk about
price, we also need to talk about all the other variables which can change.
In the case where we only consider price and quantity, there's always only one
equilibrium, because as price increases, supply rises and demand falls. (Actually,
supply and demand could be constant over some range of prices, in which case there
is an interval of equilibrium prices. I'm going to ignore this.)
But if we're allowed to vary quality too, there are now many possible settings of price
and quality where supply equals demand. E.g., for any ﬁxed quality level, there's
going to be one equilibrium price, for the same reason as before.
In a competitive market, the equilibrium will be the point on the supply-equals-
demand curve which maximizes eﬃciency. E.g., if there's a way that producers could
increase quality that would make production cost $1 more, producers will only do that

if it makes the product worth more than $1 more valuable to consumers. This is
optimal.
(In real life, you usually have producers selling a variety of diﬀerent similar goods at
diﬀerent price/quality points; I'm talking about this restricted case because it's
simpler.)
Now, suppose that the government imposes a restriction on price or quality. For
example, they might set a maximum or minimum price, or they might make safety
restrictions which restrict quality in certain ways. The market will reequilibriate by
using whatever degrees of freedom it has left. Speciﬁcally, it will reequilibriate to the
optimal point within the newly restricted space of points at which supply equals
demand. In general, this will lead to a less eﬃcient outcome.
For example, if the price of bread is $2 at equilibrium, and the government sets a
maximum price of $1.50, then the equilibrium will move along the quality curve until
it gets to the point where the equilibrium price is $1.50.
This analysis gets more realistic if you allow there to be more dimensions than price
and quantity along which bread can vary. For example, I'd expect to see the following
phenomena:
Producers trying to ﬁgure out ways to get paid under the table, e.g., by
demanding favors in return for selling to people. This reduces eﬃciency
inasmuch as producers weren't already being compensated by miscellaneous
favors.
Sellers changing in ways that are mildly more convenient for them but much
more inconvenient for consumers. For example, having long lines outside stores,
or treating customers worse.
Producers indulging weak preferences of theirs in who they sell to (e.g.,
nepotism).
In the case of minimum wages, I'd expect to see employers do things like engaging in
wage theft which the employees tolerate (which is ineﬃcient because it increases
variance for employees) or being inﬂexible and unpleasant. This analysis would
predict that wage theft is much more common among minimum wage employees than
employees at higher wages.
One way of thinking about the eﬃciency of this is to think from the perspective of the
producers. They have to pick some change that makes the price of the bread $1.50.
There are many ways they could reduce the price to $1.50. They're going to pick the
way that is best for them.
In some cases, this leads to almost no value being destroyed at all. For example, in
the bread case, sellers might sell smaller loaves, which might be almost as eﬃcient if
you dubiously assume that the main cost of bread is ﬂour. The worst case is that
there's no way for the seller to change the product to keep it proﬁtable which beneﬁts
them, and so they end up changing it in a way which makes them very little better oﬀ.
The welfare impact of this kind of regulation is also aﬀected by redistributive eﬀects.
For example, if bakers decide to only sell bread to their friends and family, this has a
positive redistributive eﬀect if the friends and family of bakers are poorer than
average.

An example where the redistributive eﬀect might make the world much better:
Suppose that there's demand for 100 loaves of bread, where half of that comes from
poor people who want to feed their children and the other half comes from a tech
billionaire who wants to make a giant bread sculpture. If the baker ends up selling to
people who are most willing to stand in lines, then this might lead to a better
outcome. (Getting this result requires making some pretty strong assumptions about
the shape of the relevant curves.)
Another example is that you might expect that in a world where the minimum wage
causes low-paid jobs to be more unpleasant, teenagers will be less inclined to take the
jobs and poor adults will end up having relatively more of the jobs. It's possible to set
things up such that this ends up increasing total welfare.
Conclusion
It's embarrassing that I was conﬁdently wrong about my understanding of so many
things in the same domain. I've updated towards thinking that microeconomics is
trickier than most other similarly straightforward-seeming subjects like physics, math,
or computer science. I think that the above misconceptions are more serious than any
misconceptions about other technical ﬁelds which I've discovered over the last few
years (except maybe the aestivation hypothesis thing).
In three of these cases (4, 5, and 6), I had incorrect beliefs that came from my high
school economics class. In those three cases, the correct understanding makes
government intervention look worse. I think that this is not a coincidence—I think that
the people who wrote the IB economics curriculum are probably leftist and this colored
their perception.
On the other hand, in the other cases, I assumed that the equilibria of markets had a
variety of intuitive properties that they turn out not to have.
One obvious question is: how many more of these am I going to discover over the
next year or two?
I think my median guess is that over the next year I will learn two more items that I
think deserve to go on this list. Of course, I'm now a lot more cautious about being
conﬁdent about microeconomics arguments, so I don't expect to be as conﬁdently
wrong as I was about some of these.
In most of these cases, there was a phase where I no longer believed the false thing
but didn't properly understand the true thing. During this phase, I wouldn't have made
bets. Currently I'm in the "not making bets" phase with regard to a few other topics in
economics; hopefully in a year I'll understand them.

Swiss Political System: More than You
ever Wanted to Know (I.)
Swiss political system may be best known for its extensive use of referenda. However,
others may argue that its most striking feature is the ability to avoid political
polarization. In this respect it may be unique among the western nations.
That being said, it is hard to learn much about how it works. First, a big part of the
system is informal and thus only discoverable by observing it personally or by asking
the locals. Second, it's strongly decentralized. Diﬀerent rules apply in diﬀerent cantons
and municipalities which makes the topic confusing to study. Third, Swiss aren't
especially interested in promoting their own system abroad. A lot of the resources
therefore exist only in local languages.
In this article I'll try to put together what I've learned by living in the country, speaking
to local people, following local press and studying the resources.
Still, a disclaimer is due: I am not Swiss. I have lived here only for ﬁve years. Neither
am I a political scientists or a sociologist. If you are Swiss, or simply know better than
me, let me know about any inaccuracies in the article.
On the more technical side of things: There's a lot of material to cover, and the result
may be rather overwhelming. It would be a small book rather than a long article.
Therefore, I am going to split this essay into three or four installments which I will
publish one at a time.
Semi-direct Democracy
When modern Switzerland was established in 1848, it was a pretty standard
representative democracy, mostly based on the American model.
It's a federal state. Federal elections are held every four years. People are represented
by political parties. There are two chambers of the parliament. Parliament elects
members of the government, who then together run the country. The thriving
ecosystem of various voluntary associations resembles the America that Alexis de
Toqueville has written about.
However, Switzerland is special in that various elements of direct democracy were
introduced in the course of history.
There are obligatory referenda: Any change in constitution, adjustment of taxes or
joining any international organization must be approved by the people and the
cantons. There are legislative referenda: Any law enacted by the parliament may be
challenged and rejected in a referendum. Finally, there are so called "popular
initiatives" which can propose a referendum on any topic. If the initiative manages to
collect speciﬁed amount of signatures within speciﬁed amount of time the referendum
is organized and the initiative may eventually get enacted. All of these referenda exist
not only on the federal, but also on the cantonal and the municipal level. All of them
are binding and neither of them needs a quorum.

To understand the scope of the thing, consider that a 37-year-old from the city of
Zurich who turned 18 in year 2000, has, in past 20 years, had the opportunity to take
part in 548 referenda, 181 of them being on the federal, 176 on the cantonal and 191
on the municipal level. With the average turnout of 45% it means that they have voted
in approximately 246 referenda.
Due to their large number, individual referenda are not organized separately. Instead,
they are voted on in batches, typically four times a year.
To get a ﬂavor of how it feels like, here's the batch from the city of Zurich in February
2020:
popular Initiative "Aﬀordable Housing": A sensitive issue especially in big cities
like Zurich or Geneva, where rents are some of the most expensive in the world.
The initiative proposes to build at least 10% of aﬀordable, non-proﬁt or
cooperative ﬂats, as well as a pre-emptive right for cantons and municipalities to
buy land. It also proposes that infrastructure upgrades should be done without
reducing the number of available ﬂats. The referendum is held at the federal
level. 46.5% in favor. Rejected.
Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation: Switzerland has
previously prohibited discrimination on grounds of race, religion, age or political
aﬃliation. This proposal adds sexual orientation to the list. Federal referendum.
63.52% of in favor. Enacted.
Law on passenger transport in taxis and limousines: A law that introduces the
same rules for Uber and similar services and for the traditional taxi services. At
the same time, it moves the enforcement of these rules from municipalities to the
canton. The law was issued by the government of the canton of Zurich and
challenged by a public initiative. (Not the least argument being that the law gives
too much power to the canton at the expense of the municipalities.) Cantonal
referendum. 52.84% of in favor. Approved.
Rosengarten tunnel and tram project: A plan by the canton to put 1.1 billion
francs into rebuilding the busiest street in Zurich and moving the traﬃc
underground. The plan was challenged by a public initiative. Cantonal
referendum. 36.32% of in favor. Rejected.
People 's initiative "Reduce the tax burden for lower and middle income people":
An attempt to reduce income inequality. The proposal adjusts the cantonal taxes
by raising the threshold for non-taxable income, as well as by increasing the tax
burden in the highest income brackets. Cantonal referendum. 42.04% in favor.
Rejected.
popular Initiative "Lower Taxes for Everyone": A proposal to reduce cantonal taxes
for the highest income groups. The aim is to prevent the relocation of the wealthy
people to tax havens such as the cantons of Zug or Schwyz. Cantonal
referendum. 29.63% in favor. Rejected.
Partial replacement of the tram depot in Hard district by new communal ﬂats. The
city proposes to take a loan of 203 million francs. Municipal referendum. 70.9% in
favor. Adopted.
The canton publishes a handbook for each ballot, which explains, in quite a lot of detail,
including graphs, maps and tables, what each referendum is about. Take the

Rosengarten tunnel project. The guide devotes eight pages to explain the project,
including topics such as the impact on the traﬃc situation in the canton, the impact on
the environment, or a detailed explanation of the ﬁnancing of the project. It states that
both the cantonal government and parliament recommend voting in favor of the
proposal. It is followed by the opinion of the minority in the cantonal parliament,
arguing that the costs are too high, that the ﬁnancial contribution from the federal
government is uncertain, and that the project doesn't really address the existing
problem. They recommend to vote against. The next page contains the opinion of the
parliament of the city of Zurich. They argue, in rather strong terms, against the project.
Finally, there's the opinion of the referendum commission, which is, as one would
expect, against the tunnel.
If even the election guide is not enough, you can have a look at the websites
advocating for the yes and no vote, respectively. While the website against is relatively
minimalist, the in favor side has a long list of supporters. In addition to almost all
political parties, there's a long list of supportive associations: The Automobile Club, the
Association for the Promotion of Public Transport, the Employers' Association, the
Association of Construction Companies of Canton Schaﬀhausen, the Association of
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, the Property Owners' Association, Swiss Travel
Club, Zurich Chamber of Commerce and the like. Many of these organizations have also
published their own assessment of the project.
As can be seen, the voters aren't exposed to a simple, black and white choice. Instead,
they are drawn into a complex network of diﬀerent preferences: Your party is in favor,
but the deputies of your municipality are against. You are a member of the automobile
club and the club is in favor. But your neighbors are against. Voting necessarily means
understanding that things are never clear-cut.
Mandatory Referenda
Any change to the constitution must be approved by the voters in a referendum.
There's no way around it. If you want to change the constitution, you need the majority
of voters and the majority of cantons to vote for it. Period. (To clarify: Canton is
considered to be in favor if the majority of voters in the canton are in favor.)
While this may seem as a reasonable rule on its own, it is in fact an important piece
that complements the overall system. The results of popular initiatives are, for
example, written into the constitution, meaning that they can't be overturned, except
by a diﬀerent referendum. (On the other hand, it gives the Swiss Constitution a rather
special character. It begins with the thundering: "In the name of Almighty God! We, the
Swiss people and cantons, mindful of our responsibility to the Creation" etc., but then it
ends with guidelines for the protection of swamps and rules for building holiday
homes.)
Similarly, Switzerland has no constitutional court. The right to interpret the constitution
is granted only to the people. They may do so by running a referendum that makes the
wording of the constitution more clear.
In short, the system is crafted in such a way that there are no loopholes. No way to
disrespect the popular opinion.
In addition to the changes in constitution, referendum is also required to to join
international organizations. This way, Switzerland decided not to enter the European

Economic Area in 1992, to join Schengen area in 2005, not to join UN in 1986 and,
again, to join UN in 2002. (And yes: Palace of Nations, the headquarters of UN, is
located in Geneva and was located there for a long time even before Switzerland has
become a member.)
Legislative Referenda
Legislative referenda get the least publicity but they may be the most important of all.
Unlike constitutional referenda and public initiatives that tend to focus on big topics the
legislative referendum can challenge and reject any law, no matter how trivial, passed
by the parliament.
This keeps the parliament and the government in check on day-to-day basis. To quote
Wikipedia:
The possibility for the citizens to challenge any law inﬂuences the whole political
system. It encourages parties to form coalition governments, to minimize the risk
that an important party tries to block the action of the government by
systematically launching referendums. It gives legitimacy to political decisions. It
forces the authorities to listen to all sectors of the population, to minimize the risk
that they reject new laws in referendums. Before presenting a new bill to the
parliament, the federal government usually makes a wide consultation to ensure
that no signiﬁcant group is frontally opposed to it, and willing to launch a
referendum.
In short, legislative referenda are probably the single most important force that driving
Switzerland away from the political polarization and towards the rule by consensus.
Popular Initiatives
Popular initiative is a way to partially change the constitution in arbitrary way.
As has already been said, if any proposal collects hundred thousand signatures in a
year and a half, it is voted upon in a referendum. The result of the vote is binding and
there is no quorum. If just 1% of the population takes part and 0.51% votes in favor of
the proposal, it will be enacted and implemented.
Also, there are no restrictions on the topic of the popular initiative. In some countries
that have similar instrument in their constitution the topics are restricted. It may not be
possible to hold referenda about basic human rights or maybe about taxes. Not so in
Switzerland.
To understand what a popular initiative means, let's have a look at a little sample. What
follows are all the popular initiatives on the federal level that were voted on in the
2015-2019 election period:
"Stop urban spread." The Young Greens' initiative against suburbanization and for
stricter zoning. 36.3% in favor. Rejected.
"Swiss law instead of foreign law." Proposal for the Swiss constitution to take
precedence over international treaties. Referendum initiated by the Swiss
People's Party. 33.7% in favor. Rejected.

"For cows with horns." The initiative initiated by farmer Armin Capaul. It proposes
to subsidize the farmers who do not cut the cows' horns. 45.3% in favor. Rejected.
"For food independence." A complex proposal to support farmers. It includes a
ban on genetically modiﬁed organisms. 31.6% in favor. Rejected.
"Fair-food initiative." The Greens' attempt to introduce restrictions that would
promote fair, environmentally friendly agriculture and prevent food waste. 38.7%
in favor. Rejected.
"For full-reserve banking." The initiative proposes that the Swiss National Bank
should be the only source of money. Other banks would have to have cash
reserves suﬃcient to pay out all the deposits. Initiative of the association "For the
Modernization of Currency". 24.3% in favor. Rejected.
"Against radio and television fees." Publicist Olivier Kessler's proposal to abolish
fees for state-owned media. 28.4% in favor. Rejected.
"For phasing out nuclear energy." An initiative launched by the Green Party. It
proposes to decommission all the Swiss nuclear power plants by 2029. 45.8% in
favor. Rejected.
"For strong social insurance" An initiative of the largest Swiss trade union. It
demands to increase payments to the social insurance by 10%. 40.6% in favor.
Rejected.
"For green economy." The initiative calls for the Swiss economy to function in a
sustainable way. The government should set goals and report on how they are
achieved at each session of the parliament. If the progress lags behind, additional
measures should be taken. 36.6% in favor. Rejected.
"For universal basic income." An initiative was initiated by several individuals. It
proposes an unconditional regular income for all. The amount of income and the
method of ﬁnancing should be determined by law. 23.1% in favor. Rejected.
The so-called "Dairy Cow" initiative. It suggests that the entirety of the fuel tax
income should be spent on road maintenance. 29.2% in favor. Rejected.
"Pro Public Service." The constitution should explicitly stipulate that state and
semi-state organizations (post oﬃce, railways, telephone) are not run for ﬁnancial
gain. It also limits the salaries of the employees in these organizations. 32.4% in
favor. Rejected.
"Stop food speculation!" Young Socialists' initiative. It proposes to ban certain
ﬁnancial instruments in the area of   agricultural products. It orders the Federal
Government to combat such practices also at the international level. 40.1% in
favor. Rejected.
"For enforcing the expulsion of criminal aliens." Initiative of the Swiss People's
Party. The party was dissatisﬁed with the government's implementation of the
successful referendum on the expulsion of criminal aliens held in 2010. 41.1% in
favor. Rejected.
"Against ﬁnes for marriage." The initiative of Christian Democrats, who did not
like that in some cases unmarried couples paid less taxes than married couples.
49.2% in favor. Rejected.

Small cantonal or municipal popular initiatives are probably not that interesting for a
reader from abroad, but still, let's mention a few of them. In recent years, the voters in
the canton of Zurich have voted on: Deﬁnition of marriage as a union of a man and a
woman. For the expansion of the Stadelhofen railway station. For the replacement of
hunting associations by professional nature conservationists. For the harmonization of
school curricula in German-speaking cantons. For one, instead of the two, compulsory
foreign languages   in schools. For the law to support for the ﬁlm and gaming industry.
For economic organizations to take part in funding kindergartens. For the abolition of
the commission reviewing the claims of rejected asylum seekers. For eﬀective control
of minimum wages. All of those initiatives were rejected.
It is also worth looking at the history of popular initiatives.
When modern Switzerland was founded in 1848 there was a clause in the constitution
that the people could change the constitution. It was generally interpreted to mean
that the constitution could only be replaced in its entirety. The instrument of the
popular initiative was not established until 1891.
When we look at the list of all the popular initiatives, we notice that the instrument of
popular initiative was little used at the beginning. The number of popular initiatives
soars only in the seventies. The graph shows the number of all popular initiatives in
blue and the number of successful ones in red.
The reason is that only by then did the instrument get working really smoothly.
In the beginning, for example, the custom of "putting the initiatives into the drawer"
has become established. The new initiatives were simply left in the vacuum, without a
referendum, until they were forgotten, or until the initiative had lost all of its political

relevance. One particular initiative was literally forgotten and canceled only after
spending 43 years in a drawer.
After this system was heavily criticized in the press, the government eventually gave
up on it.
The next trick was to make a government counter-proposal for a popular initiative and
thus divide its supporters. If, say, 60% of the people were in favor of the initiative, the
two proposals (the original proposal and the government's counter-proposal) divided
them into two groups of 30% each, so that neither proposal passed.
This problem was solved in 1987 by the introducing so-called "double yes" which
makes it is possible to vote for both the initiative and the oﬃcial counterproposal. An
additional question has also been introduced which asks which of the proposals one
would favor if both proposals were successful.
Next, there is the problem of the validity of the referendum.
The Swiss constitution does not limit the subject of the popular initiative in any way.
The only requirement it makes is that it has a coherent content. In practice, this means
that the voter should never be forced to say yes or no to a question that mixes two
unrelated matters. (Example: Do you want Putin to be able to run for a president for
two more election periods and adjust the state pension in line with the inﬂation?)
So, for example, the popular initiative which called for a reduction in military spending
and the use of the money for social purposes, was canceled. The government's
argument was that the ﬁnancing of the army and the ﬁnancing of social aﬀairs are two
independent issues that cannot be conﬂated in one referendum.
The argument sounds reasonable. But then one notices that some of the constitutional
changes initiated by parliament are cheerfully mixing changes in various parts of the
constitution. The system is unbalanced in this respect and the problem has not been
solved yet.
Next, there is the problem of the consistency of the proposal with international treaties.
The ﬁrst historical case had to do with a contract with Germany about the construction
of a hydroelectric power plant in Rheinau on the border of the two states. According to
the contract, the concession could not be canceled unilaterally. When the government,
in 1954, allowed the popular initiative for the abolition of the power plant, it opened up
the question of what happens if a referendum contradicts Switzerland's international
commitments.
Back in the day, Switzerland avoided embarrassment because the initiative against the
Rheinau power plant has not been successful. In recent years, however, there have
been couple of successful initiatives that contradict international treaties.
One of them was the initiative for the automatic expulsion of criminal aliens in 2010. As
the result of the referendum was never properly put into practice, in 2018 the original
author of the initiative (Swiss People's Party) comes up with a diﬀerent initiative
proposing that the Swiss constitution - and therefore the results of the popular
initiatives - should always take precedence to the international law - with the exception
of those international treaties that were approved in a referendum.
Should a referendum pass, Switzerland could at any time revoke its existing
international obligations and would be considered an unreliable partner abroad. Which,

of course, could be a serious problem for Switzerland's export-oriented economy.
However, the referendum did not pass and so the problem is still unresolved. We can
only guess how it will turn out. Maybe, one day, all international treaties will be voted
on to gain unquestionable legitimacy. However, even this will not solve the problem of
already existing international treaties and retroactive changes through popular
initiatives.
To explore another serious and hard-to-ﬁx ﬂaw in the Swiss political system, let's have
a look at the initiative "Against Mass Immigration".
First, some background.
Immigration is a serious issue in Switzerland. In that it diﬀers from certain countries,
including my native Slovakia, where immigration is negligible, but it is nevertheless
used as a bogeyman to score political points. In Switzerland, a quarter of the country's
population does not have Swiss citizenship. In city cantons such as Zurich or Geneva,
the proportion of foreigners is even higher. There's even a lot of third generation
immigrants who still don't hold Swiss passport.
The problem began after the second world war, when Switzerland, spared by the war,
became an attractive country to immigrate to. People started moving in and that
caused political tensions, as witnessed by no less than seven referenda against
immigration between years 1968 and 2000. As Max Frisch once pointedly noted: "We
asked for workforce and people came instead."
The number of non-citizens is nowadays so high that it's not only the xenophobes who
lose their sleep. Traditional conservatives are worried as well: Is it possible to preserve
the existing communal and political culture with that many foreigners? And so are
liberals: Can a country where quarter of population doesn't have the right to vote be
still called a democracy?
After all the anti-immigration referenda failed during the second half of the 20th
century (support varied from 29.5% to 46.3%), initiative "Against Mass Immigration"
ﬁnally succeeds in 2014 with 50.33% of the vote in favor. It asks for introducing quotas
for foreigners, such that they "align with Switzerland's economic interests and favor
Swiss citizens."
The government announces that it will act quickly and pass the necessary legislation
before the end of the year. One week after the referendum, Swiss Minister of Justice
calls Croatian Minister of Foreign Aﬀairs and informs her that Switzerland won't sign the
draft agreement, which gives Croatia (then a new EU member state) free access to the
Swiss labor market.
The European Commission responds that one can't cherry-pick from the freedoms
enshrined in the treaty and that restricting freedom of movement will jeopardize Swiss
access to the single European market. Brussels promptly suspends talks on cooperation
in the sphere of education (Erasmus+ project with the budget of € 14.7 billion for the
next six years) and science (Horizon 2020, € 80 billion budget for the same period). It
also suspends talks on integrating the Swiss electricity market into the European
market.
Universities report estimated losses on research grants in order of hundred millions
euros. The government itself estimates that exclusion from Horizon 2020 will
jeopardize 8,000 jobs. Higher electricity prices are expected. The student union is

protesting because students suddenly do not know if they will be able to start the
planned student exchanges. Credit Suisse is lowering its estimate of Swiss economic
growth (from 1.9% to 1.6%) and expects that about 80,000 fewer jobs will be created.
The government ﬁnds itself between a rock and a hard place. After three years, just a
few months before the deadline for implementing the referendum expires, it abandons
the idea of   immigration quotas and introduces few half-hearted bureaucratic obstacles
to employing EU citizens.
The country suddenly ﬁnds itself in an uncomfortable situation where the law is, strictly
speaking, in a conﬂict with the constitution. (Recall that the results of referenda are
written into the constitution.) At the same time, Switzerland does not have a
constitutional court, which would reject the oﬀending laws. Only the people are
supposed to interpret the constitution through a referendum.
To appreciate how dangerous that is, consider that the Swiss system of direct
democracy is based on the people modifying the constitution and government
subsequently implementing those changes in law. If government starts to disregard the
constitution, the system collapses. People may vote for whatever they want and it
would have no eﬀect. They can, in theory, challenge unconstitutional laws in legislative
referenda, but interpreting hundreds of pages of legalese is probably too much to ask
from an ordinary citizen. At the same time, there's no legal instrument to either
challenge a standing law after it's in place for 100 days or to introduce a new law by
means of a referendum.
To be fair, a new form of initiative, so called "general popular initiative" was introduced
by the government in 2003 that allowed for changing federal law. The instrument was
approved in a referendum (70.3% in favor) but later it turned out that a lot of voters
had no idea what it was about. In fact, it turned out that even government haven't had
a good idea. When they tried to implement it they found out that there are so many
pitfalls and complications that it's not feasible. In 2008 they proposed that the new
instrument is removed from the constitution and the people approved the removal in a
referendum (67.9% in favor).
In any case, the story continues with People's party, the initiator of the anti-
immigration referendum shouting treason, but then announcing that they will not
challenge the decision in another referendum. Instead, they opt to challenge the
outcome indirectly, with an initiative asking for Swiss law - and thus the outcome of the
anti-mass immigration initiative - to take precedence over international treaties - and
thus over the Treaty on Free Movement with the EU. The initiative is rejected in a
referendum.
In 2018, signature collection begins for a new referendum. The proposal instructs the
government to negotiate the removal of free movement clauses from the treaties with
the European Union and, if that does not happen, establishes automatic termination of
said treaties. The referendum was scheduled for May 2020, but postponed due to the
coronavirus epidemic. That being said, the surveys show that the referendum will most
likely fail and the problem of discrepancy between the constitution and the law will
persist.
To conclude, it is worth noting how the discussion is becoming more and more nuanced
over the years. In the 19th century, it was disputed whether a partial change in the
constitution through a popular initiative was permissible at all. Then we see the
government openly sabotaging the legal instrument. Today, 130 years after it was

introduced, the Swiss are ﬁnally dealing with the actual messy problems that the usage
of popular initiatives entails.
Dangerous Referenda
A common argument against referenda is that they are dangerous. Let's recall how
Lukashenko entrenched himself in the power: The referendum in 1995 gave him the
power to dissolve the parliament. In 1996, again in a referendum, Belarusians decided
that the presidential decrees would have force of law. Finally, the referendum in 2004
extended the presidential term indeﬁnitely.
Or, for that matter, recall the Brexit referendum and the political chaos it plunged the
UK into.
Given this danger and the fact - quite noticeable in the previous sample - that 90% of
the popular initiatives tend to be rejected, one has to ask whether Switzerland gains
any beneﬁts from using the instrument at all.
But contemplating it, one may wonder whether the fact that out of all 210 popular
initiatives that were voted on since 1891 only 22 were successful isn't besides the
point. Perhaps it doesn't matter how many initiatives are being rejected. Perhaps the
only thing that matters is that there's a safeguard when a conﬂict of interest between
the people and their elected representatives arises. In such a situation a popular
initiative may adjust the political system in such a way as to align the interests of the
representatives with the interests of the people anew.
But as we look at the successful popular initiatives, we see almost no cases of such
initiatives. At least at ﬁrst glance, it is not clear why the topic of swamp protection or
the topic of the construction of holiday homes should lead to a conﬂict of this kind.
However, two historical initiatives are an exception to the rule.
Back in 1917 Switzerland used to use majority system in the parliamentary elections.
This led to a situation where the Liberal Democrats got only 40.8% of the vote, but
54.5% of the seats in parliament. The absolute majority allowed them to pass the laws,
regardless of the will of the 59.2% who voted for other parties.
Needless to say, Liberal Democrats torpedoed every attempt to replace the majority
voting system by a proportional one. If the instrument of popular initiatives was not
available, it would be a dead end. The voters would have to wait until Liberal
Democrats lose some of their voter support. But even then, thanks to the majority
system, an absolute majority in parliament could be won by another party, who would
again ﬁnd it diﬃcult to abolish the system that brought it to power.
General dissatisfaction with the state of aﬀairs led to the launch of the popular
initiative "For a proportional system of elections to the National Council" in 1918 which
succeeded with 66.8% votes in favor.
In 1919, elections were ﬁnally held using the new, proportional system and Liberal
Democrats lost the absolute majority.
The second exception happened in the period after World War II. During the war, a
state of emergency was declared, in which a large number of otherwise decentralized
powers were transferred to the federal government. After the war, the government

refused to relinquish those powers. In 1949, however, the popular initiative "For a
Return to Direct Democracy" (50.7% in favor) returned matters to pre-war state.
But however important those two exceptions may be, do they justify the existence of
popular initiatives? To justify a powerful and dangerous instrument like that, one would
expect to gain at least some day-to-day advantage rather than something that
happens twice in a century.
Well, it turns out that referenda, in fact, serve an important day-to-day purpose: They
act as a sword hanging over the parliament and the government.
Consider the legislative referendum. It can be used to block any law passed by
parliament. The consequence, which, while obvious, does not occur immediately, is
that the parliament simply does not pass laws that are apparently going to be
challenged and rejected in a referendum.
Often, even a threat of referendum is enough to cause a change in the law or even let
it be dropped altogether.
What's more, both the government and the parliament are very well aware of the
possibility of a referendum and so they proactively make sure that no signiﬁcant group
of the population has a reason to block the new law.
Additionally, a zero quorum for a referendum means that even small minorities must be
taken into account: If the law discriminates against, say, the hearing impaired, the rest
of the nation may well ignore the referendum, but the deaf and deaf-mute will still be
able to force its abolition.
The popular initiatives complement the system: Legislative referenda can be used only
to reject new laws. Popular initiatives can be used to challenge old and dysfunctional
ones.
And now it's becoming clear why almost all popular initiatives are rejected. If the
initiative had a obvious chance of being approved, the parliament would introduce the
necessary legislation on its own. From this point of view the small number of successful
initiatives is not a sign of a system malfunction, but rather a proof that the system is
functioning the way it is expected to.
In some cases in happens, that initiative has a chance to pass, but the government or
parliament considers it harmful or disadvantageous. In these cases, they can come up
with a so-called counter-proposal. The counter-proposal is typically a compromise. If
the initiative asks for 100, the counter-proposal oﬀers 50. Voters can then choose
between rejecting the initiative altogether, accepting it, or accepting the counter-
proposal.
In 2014, for example, the Evangelical Party of canton Zurich initiates a popular
initiative for reducing the size of classes in schools. The initiative proposes a cap of 20
students per class. The cantonal parliament oﬀers a counter-proposal in which it
promises to create 100 new teaching jobs and distribute those teachers preferentially
into municipalities that suﬀer the most from the problems with large class sizes. In the
end, voters opted for the government counter-proposal.
The eﬃciency of the system of counter-proposals is witnessed not only by them being
accepted on quite regular basis, but also by the fact that 73 federal popular initiatives

were, in the course of history, withdrawn by their initiators in favor of the government
counter-proposals.
There are yet more functions of popular initiatives.
To understand the next one, consider the process that each initiative goes through: The
Federal Council will ﬁrst check the referendum and translate it into all oﬃcial
languages. Then, the signatures are collected. The limit for collecting a suﬃcient
number of signatures is one year and a half. The signature sheets are then handed
over to the Federal Council. The government has a year and a half to discuss the
proposal. If it decides to ﬁle a counter-proposal, this period is extended by another year
and a half. Consultations with experts and all the stakeholders are held within this time.
The government prepares a detailed report and passes it to the parliament. Parliament
has another year and a half to discuss it. In the case of a counter-proposal, the period
can be prolonged to three and a half years. Finally, the government sets a date for the
referendum, which must happen within the next ten months.
The whole initiative, from the draft proposal to the vote, can therefore take up to nine
years. In practice, this period usually ranges from two to six years.
The process seems highly ineﬃcient at a ﬁrst glance, but when one listens to what
Swiss political scientists have to say on the matter, it becomes clear that this
sluggishness is not a bug, but rather a feature. Some even distinguish between a real
referendum (in Switzerland) and a plebiscite (everywhere else). One important
diﬀerence is that the long duration of the process, which spans across election periods,
prevents the referendum from being used for tactical purposes. Another diﬀerence is
that it provides ample time for in-depth public debate.
And there's a lot of debate. It is not just the consultations organized by the government
and parliament. The referenda are discussed in the media, both in serious newspapers
and in tabloids, which are handed out for free at tram stops. They are discussed among
colleagues at work during the lunch. They are discussed within the family during the
dinner. At night they are discussed in pubs and bars. Associations, companies, political
parties, government, parliament, all kinds of organizations and individuals all
recommend voting either in favor or against. Public discussions are organized. Every
simpleton feels obligated to express himself on the subject.
When election day comes, one may get an election handbook that presents both sides
of the argument, but at that moment, one's head is already ﬁlled of various arguments,
both in favor and against. One has become, at least to some extent, an expert on the
subject. (And if you think about it, the 548 referenda in Zurich in past 20 years mean
that the educational aspect of the system may be surprisingly large.)
To put the above in diﬀerent words, a popular initiative can also be understood as a call
for a public debate on a certain topic. The fact that it is followed by a binding vote
ensures that people actually do care about the debate. True, the vast majority of
popular initiatives are rejected, but at that point there has been a public discourse and
people are at least aware of the matter. With referenda on matters such as universal
basic income or full reserve banking, one would expect widening of the Overton
window. However, I wasn't able to ﬁnd a study comparing the size of the window in
Switzerland and elsewhere.
One can also think of the public debate as a safety measure. Particular initiative may
be dangerous, if approved, but when people go to ballots they are already well aware
of the danger.

Another safety measure is that Swiss referenda are, in their essence, not polarizing. In
referendum you are never asked to decide between two extremes, between, say, pro-
life and pro-choice, but rather between the initiative proposal and the status quo.
Voting against is always a safe and neutral option. It doesn't necessarily mean that you
are not sympathetic to the spirit of the initiative. You may just think it's going too far, or
maybe you like some aspects of it but don't like some other.
Consider the 2013 vote on the law granting special powers to the government in case
of epidemic. Some people were against the proposal because they though it makes the
federal government too powerful. At the same time they've kept quiet about it because
they haven't wanted to be seen as part of the anti-vaxxer crowd which was dominating
the debate. Luckily, voting against was a neutral choice they could take advantage of.
It haven't meant that vaccination programmes would be relaxed. It just meant that
status quo would be preserved.
Referenda as Tools: The Jurassic
Question
The history of the Jurassic question begins after the Napoleonic Wars, in 1815, when
the Jura region, traditionally part of the Principality-Bishopric of Basel, was annexed to
the canton of Bern.
Jura, however, unlike Bern, is French-speaking and to make the situation worse, while
the southern part of Jura is predominantly Protestant, same as Bern, the northern part
of it is Catholic.
So, starting in 1826, several separatist movements emerge in Jura, fueled mainly by
religious frictions, the question of the separation of church and state, and later, to
some extent, the nationalism based on the language.
Modern Jurassic separatism dates back to 1947, when the Bern cantonal parliament
refused to grant the position of construction minister to Jurassic politician Georges
Moeckli on the grounds that he doesn't speak Bernese dialect good enough. That has
opened the old wounds.
The following events are chaotic. The emergence of diﬀerent opposition movements,
mutual insults, demonstrations, public burning of a civil defense handbook, demolition
of a statue of an unknown soldier, occupation of Swiss embassies abroad, bombs,
paving stones and, unfortunately, several casualties.
In short, the whole range of events that accompany separatist movements around the
world.
However, unlike in Northern Ireland, where the violence spiraled out of control at
approximately the same time, Switzerland has succeeded - not least through the
extensive use of the instruments of direct democracy - to keep the situation under
control and eventually, if at the typical Swiss sluggish pace, to resolve it.
We can't go into details here, but let's at least look at a short timeline:
1968: Establishment of two commissions (one bilateral and one impartial) to
propose a plan to address the Jurassic question.

March 1970: The plan is approved in a referendum. The following referendums
are proceeding according to the approved plan.
June 1974: Referendum on whether to create a new canton Jura. Approved.
March 1975: Districts that voted against the new canton in a previous referendum
decide about their fate. The southern, Protestant part of the Jura decides to
remain in the canton of Bern.
Autumn 1975: Municipalities at the border between the two cantons decide in
referenda whether to join Bern or Jura.
September 1978: In a federal referendum, the Swiss constitution is amended to
list the new canton (82.3% of the vote in favor).
Note the architectural beauty of the process. How the referendum is cleverly used to
relieve the tension. Step by step, in cold blood, room for manoeuvre is taken from
those who beneﬁt from inciting conﬂict.
Firstly, the referendum on the process of resolving the issue was separated from the
referendum on the issue itself. The fact that the process was approved in advance in a
referendum gave legitimacy to the following referendums on speciﬁc issues and, the
other way round, deprived the subsequent attempts to challenge the results of
legitimacy.
Secondly, the fact that the process proposed by the preparatory commission had to be
subsequently approved in a referendum created pressure in the commission to ﬁnd a
compromise solution. If they leaned too far to one side, there was a risk that the
process would be rejected in the referendum and that the entire work of the
commission would end up in the trash, along with the political careers of everyone
involved.
Thirdly, note how, in the sequence of referendums, it were only those territorial units
that voted against the winning solution, that got an additional vote. That prevented
unending oscillation between Bern and Jura. The number of disputed areas kept
constantly decreasing with each subsequent step of the process.
Finally, the ongoing process siphoned the moderates, who would otherwise have no
option but to join radicals, towards peaceful campaigning for the oncoming referenda.
The events do not end with the creation of the new canton in 1979 though.
In the referenda above, the municipality of Laufen decided to remain in the canton of
Bern, creating a Bern enclave between the cantons of Jura, Solothurn and Basel-
Country. The events continued as follows:
November 1977: popular initiative "Do you want to start the process of
connecting Laufen to the neighboring canton?" succeeds with 65% of the votes
for.
January 1980: Referendum precludes Laufen joining the canton of Basel-City.
March 1980: In yet another referendum, Laufen decides to start negotiations with
the canton of Basel-Country (64.65% in favor).
September 1983: Unsuccessful referendum on joining the canton of Basel-
Country. 56.68% vote against. Laufen remains in the canton of Bern. (A parallel
referendum in the canton of Basel-Country approves the adoption of Laufen by a
majority of 73% of the votes.)
1985: A scandal with discovery of the secret fund to ﬁnance Bernese loyalists in
Laufen. The Bern Parliament rejects the complaint of the citizens of Lausanne.
They bring the case before the Federal Court. The court orders a new referendum.

November 1989: Laufen decides to join the canton of Basel-Country (51.72% in
favor).
September 1991: Canton of Basel-Country votes to accept Laufen. The decision is
less warm than in 1983, but the referendum still passes (59.3% in favor).
September 1993: Federal referendum approves the annexation of Laufen to the
canton of Basel-Country (75.2% in favor).
But the question of the so-called Bernese Jura (Protestant parts of Jura that have not
joined the new canton) is still not resolved to the general satisfaction. Separatist
haven't yet given up.
In February 2012 the governments of the cantons of Bern and Jura agree to deliver a
solution to the problem. In November 2013, two referenda are held, one in Jura, the
other in Bernese Jura. The referenda pose the question of whether to begin the process
of creating a new canton that would include both areas. Should the referendum pass, a
commission would be set up to propose a detailed process, which would then be voted
upon in a referendum. The preliminary idea was that every municipality in the Bernese
Jura would vote on whether to stay in the canton of Bern or join the canton of Jura.
Although the referendum succeeds in the canton of Jura (64.2% in favor), it fails in
Berenese Jura (28.15% in favor). Thus, the question of the Great Jura is deﬁnitely oﬀ
the table. Any further inciting of the Jurassic question loses political legitimacy.
The last painful spot is the town of Moutier, the only district in Bernese Jura which
voted for the creation of the Great Jura (55% in favor).
Shortly after the previous referendum, the city of Moutier decides to hold a municipal
referendum on joining the canton of Jura.
January 2016: The canton of Bern approves the referendum.
June 2017: The referendum accepts the joining of the canton of Jura (51.72% of
the vote in favor).
November 2018: The prefecture of Bernese Jura, complains about the
irregularities in the referendum and declares the result invalid.
October 2019: After the Bernese court conﬁrmed the abolition of the referendum,
the city council decides not to pursue the matter in front of the federal court, but
rather to hold a new referendum in 2020.
And so, if everything goes well, the Jurassic question will be deﬁnitively resolved soon,
after more than two centuries of conﬂict.
Next part

Rereading Atlas Shrugged
This post will not attempt to avoid spoilers, and will be much more comprehensible if
you've read the book or are familiar with its basics, but I also hope it'll be somewhat
understandable if you haven't read the book at all; to aid with that I'll put summaries
after all the names.
I ﬁrst read Atlas Shrugged as a teenager, I think for an essay contest. I was already a
libertarian from reading Free to Choose, and found Rand's moralism oﬀputting and her
characters strange. I was a 'technical' libertarian,[1] in that I was convinced that
decentralization led to better decision-making and better results, and didn't see how
the moral libertarians made a better case than the moral statists. And even when it
came to morality, the people I saw at church were putting in signiﬁcant eﬀort to try to
be better, and yet Rand's heroes didn't seem to have any sort of moral development;
the good people were good, and the bad people were bad, and there wasn't any
engagement with the question of how to become good. I think that was the main
content of my essay, and unsurprisingly it didn't win anything.
But a friend recently mentioned that they had read it and were surprised about how
much it was about rationality; I remembered some bits and said "yeah, that checks
out," but when I reread it recently was surprised at just how much there was, and how
topical much of it was to current events and decisions I'm facing.
A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old
age, as a ﬁne building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight.
― Robertson Davies
For this post I expect to slip between "how I saw Atlas Shrugged as a youth" and "how
I see it now", with the ﬁrst mostly to explain by contrast.
Creators revisited
In youth, I thought Galt's Gulch (a hideout in the Rockies accessible only to the
creators on strike) was ridiculous. You have people whose primary skills are being
executives, and they become manual laborers, and they're better oﬀ? Why think a
mining executive would be any good at digging copper himself, or an aircraft
executive would be good at raising hogs?
I think I was confused instead of enlightened by having the category of "executive."
James Taggart (the 'villain' railroad executive) would be denied entry to Galt's Gulch,
and starve if he ended up there. The primary characteristic of the creators is that they
operate oﬀ their inside view and own responsibility. Rearden (the 'hero' steel-maker)
invents a new variety of metal, not by seeing it in a ﬂash of insight, but by believing
that it's possible enough to remain determined through ten years of obstacles and
setbacks. Dagny Taggart (the 'hero' railroad executive) provides value by making
decisions using her own judgment, by paying close attention to details, and turning
towards instead of away from problems.
Some of the scientiﬁc and engineering inventions are fake, and I think in youth I
overestimated how much the characters were supposed to be mutant superheroes
instead of doing something that could be copied. Sure, you might not be able to sleep

as little as Dagny, but you could try to actually succeed in your work, and work in a
ﬁeld where that's noticed and rewarded instead of punished.
It reminds me of simulcra levels; the heroes are the people who live in 'reality', and
the villains are the people who live in 'society'.
The heroes look at the world to determine what is true; they say things they think are
true so that other people will have a more accurate model of the world; they try to
enter honest competitions, they try to win, are sportsmanlike when they lose, and
think there is no honor or proﬁt in dishonest competitions. When selling things, they
assume buyers will make their own judgments on the facts; they would market sushi
as cold, dead ﬁsh. The heroic scientists refuse to work for any institutions that accept
government funding! [2]
The villains look at other people to determine what is true; they say things they think
will enhance their position and reduce their rival's positions; they try to keep
competitions illegible, trade inﬂuence, and seek to constrain others by guilt. Over and
over again, when a non-striking hero interacts with one of the villains, Rand points out
how the hero is, through a combination of something like the principle of charity and
something like a willful blindness towards the evils of humanity, deliberately not
understanding what the villain is saying or what motivates them, because if they did
they would have to hate them. (Rand's villains are under no such compunction, and
freely hate the heroes.)
Of course, not everyone is a 'hero' or 'villain'; one of the things I saw reading it now is
how diﬀerent people have diﬀerent nuances and shades, and how many characters
are 'good' but not 'heroes', or 'bad' but not 'villains'. While the heroes and villains
often end up in deep conﬂict because of huge philosophical diﬀerences, the less
extreme characters normally are depicted having small conﬂicts because of simple
miscommunication and inability to overcome the typical mind fallacy or cultural clash
(such as ask vs. guess, or combat vs. nurture); when Rearden and his mother can't
have a real conversation, it's because both of them can't see the other, and only know
how to politely interact with their mental model of the other person (which, of course,
is not how the other person wants to be interacted with).
And so, when you say "a bunch of nerds and engineers build a frontier town with only
nerds and engineers," I say "oh yeah, that totally checks out, and I can see the
appeal." Having seen more of the power of having something to protect, and how
quickly clever people can understand things they focus on, it also no longer strains
credulity that an aircraft manufacturer could also ﬁgure out raising hogs, and having
seen what true ownership looks like, it no longer surprises me that they would choose
a 'downgrade.'[3]
The Conﬂict
In youth, I focused on the conﬂict between the creators and the looters, and watched
how Rand's ﬁctional America falls to communism and self-destructive morality. The
creators deal with absolutes and objective facts; the looters deal with negotiations
and subjective facts, and they can't overcome this methodological diﬀerence, or the
underlying moral diﬀerences. Reading it now, the interesting conﬂict is between
Dagny (the heroine who believes in humanity) and Galt (the hero who initiates the
strike).

Both of them oppose the looters. Dagny views them resigned boredom, and resolves
to work harder, believing that she can produce more blood than the leeches can drain.
Galt decides to give them what they want, good and hard. But only one strategy can
be employed at a time; if Dagny and other scabs keep civilization aﬂoat despite the
fundamental contradiction presented by the looters, then that contradiction can
remain unaddressed. If Galt and the strikers yield control over the visible earth to the
looters, then the world grinds to a halt with massive widespread misery, and the
legacies of past creators are mostly destroyed. So the two of them have a shadow war
over the creators, with Galt eventually winning.
This shadow war, of course, isn't a logistical aﬀair, but a moral and philosophical one.
When people are ready to give up on humanity, Galt visits them and puts into words
the moral feelings that they haven't heard before from anyone else, and convinces
them to give up collaboration with looters and go on strike. Valuing surprise and lived
experience over persuasion, he doesn't take his message to the public until he's won.
The Judgments
One of the things that was most striking about the book this time around was the
sense of "they should have known better." That is, not only is it good to think, and to
turn to reality for truth, but people are responsible for ﬁguring that out. Not
necessarily from scratch--but in an uncertain and embattled information ecosystem, it
matters whether or not they end up with that conclusion. Many of the side characters
have a brush with truth, and turn towards it, and then die or suﬀer an ignoble end
because they got some important fact wrong, and good intentions aren't good
enough.
Benquo's comment shows what Eddie Willers (Dagny's assistant) gets wrong--
basically, he's loyal to "the train company" instead of "thinking" or "engineering" or
"productive work", and is unable to do anything about the collapse of the world
besides "work harder," and it's not enough. Cherryl Brooks meets James Taggart and
takes at face value the public relations claim that he was behind the John Galt line
(which was actually Dagny's idea and sole eﬀort, done after he washed his hands of
it), and doesn't try to understand her environment in the right way to discover she's
being tricked until too late. Robert Stadler (the genius physicist, and one of Galt's two
teachers) wants to think about the abstractions underneath physical reality instead of
society, and so accepts whatever deal is oﬀered him by society, and ﬁnds himself
backed into a corner, his scientiﬁc discoveries used for ends horriﬁc to him, a
powerless ﬁgurehead who will say in public whatever he is asked to say. The Wet
Nurse goes to college to study metallurgy and ends up working as the bureaucrat
monitoring Rearden's mills; he eventually discovers that he wants a real job at the
mills, but the controlling regime he works for would need to approve his transfer, and
would view his desire to transfer with suspicion.
Most interesting to me is the relationship the sides have to persuasion. The looters
spend much of their time coordinating, but it's backroom deals with information as
currency and empty platitudes and guilt trips in public. They don't think the public can
think, and so their attempts to ﬁgure out what to do and their attempts to convince
the public are entirely disjoint aﬀairs.[4] The strikers think that one of the fundamental
obligations people have is ﬁguring out the state of the world, and only nudge people
into actions, instead of trying to reveal new parts of the world to them. (They're like
the man handing out blank leaﬂets.) The scabs view participation in human society as

a cost of doing business, view doing business as the primary goal in life, and don't
have anything to oﬀer other scabs besides continuing to do business together. Rather
than someone coming to Rearden and saying "hey, humanity isn't worth it, why don't
you just leave?" they wait until humanity has mistreated Rearden enough for him to
already believe it, and only needs it pointed out to him for him to realize that he
already believes it.
Consider the connection to their basic way of looking at the world: for the looter,
social reality is the dominant reality, and so they spend a lot of time attempting to
shift the views of those around them. For the striker, physical reality is their dominant
reality, and so they let facts 'speak for themselves'.
You Can Lead A Horse To Water, But
The parables from the book struck me, both the ﬁrst time around and the second.
Here's my favorite:
"I know who is John Galt," said the tramp. "It's a secret, but I know it."
"Who?" she asked without interest.
"An explorer," said the tramp. "The greatest explorer that ever lived. The man who
found the fountain of youth. John Galt spent years looking for it. He crossed
oceans, and he crossed deserts, and he went down into forgotten mines, miles
under the earth. But he found it on the top of a mountain. It took him ten years to
climb that mountain. It broke every bone in his body, it tore the skin oﬀ his hands,
it made him lose him home, his name, his love. But he climbed it. He found the
fountain of youth, which he wanted to bring down to men. Only he never came
back."
"Why didn't he?" she asked.
"Because he found that it couldn't be brought down."
My reading of this is that truth is ﬁndable, but you have to go to it, and you cannot
bring it to you. If you seek to ﬁnd out what chemical composition will lead to a better
variety of steel, you will ﬁnd it; if you seek to prove that your starting guess is right,
you will often be disappointed. And even this method of ﬁnding truth is an example of
this; if you seek out methodology with genuine curiosity, you will ﬁnd a good one, and
if you trust to what you started out with, you succeed only by luck.
This seems like a recurring theme, somehow; the sense that you can't think for
another person, and it's wrong to try. The best our explorer can do is shout down "this
is how I climbed up the mountain", but others need to climb up themselves. You can't
read your way into original thinking, or trust your way into a conﬁdent conclusion.
Incidentally, I didn't read the introduction by Leonard Peikoﬀ either read-through,
because in the second paragraph he says Rand wouldn't have wanted an introduction
to her work, instead of letting it stand on its own merits. But after my most recent
read-through, I idly read the introduction, and came across something shocking. He
quotes a diary entry by Rand:

I seem to be both a theoretical philosopher and a ﬁction writer. But it is the last
that interests me most; the ﬁrst is only the means to the last; the absolutely
necessary means, but only the means; the ﬁction story is the end. Without an
understanding and statement of the right philosophical principle, I cannot create
the right story; but the discovery of the principle interests me only as the
discovery of the proper knowledge to be used for my life purpose; and my life
purpose is the creation of the kind of world (people and events) that I like--that is,
that represents human perfection.
Philosophical knowledge is necessary in order to deﬁne human perfection. But I do
not care to stop at the deﬁnition, I want to use it, to apply it--in my work (in my
personal life, too--but the core, center and purpose of my personal life, of my
whole life, is my work).
This is why, I think, the idea of writing a philosophical non-ﬁction book bored me.
In such a book, the purpose would actually be to teach others, to present my idea
to them. In a book of ﬁction the purpose is to create, for myself, the kind of world I
want and to live in it while I am creating it; for as a secondary consequence, to let
others enjoy this world if, and to the extent that they can.
It shocks me that a book I have been given for free four times, presumably in the
hopes of cultivating a like-minded soul, was written because Rand wanted to make it
for herself, rather than to have an impact on the world, or to teach others. [It reminds
me of Mandatory Secret Identities, or the art having a purpose besides itself.]
The Relevance
When I was younger, I had a sense that while some topics might be oﬀ limits,
civilization was built on and supported reasoned debate. Then I had the sense that
more and more topics were becoming oﬀ limits and that the principles underlying
debate were being attacked directly, as well as the diﬀerence between value of topics
being much larger than I had naively expected, as existential risk makes most other
considerations irrelevant. Yes, you might not be able to speak the truth about A or B or
C, but the small gains made by society being right about any of those pale in
comparison to the gains made by society being right about X, and so to the extent
one needs a good reputation for society to heed their thoughts about X, one should be
silent on A, B, and C. But this isn't just a local thing; the sound of silence is spreading
more broadly as more people decide it's not worth it to speak up.
First they came for the epistemology. We don't know what happened after that. --
Michael Vassar
Historically speaking, this isn't really a surprise, and is more of a 'return to normalcy,'
with the accompanying observation that most of history has been quite bad to live in
on important metrics.
That is, the standard way things have gone is that there's some ruling hegemony, and
they have a vested interest in controlling the belief system of those that they rule; the
principles of classical liberalism, like freedom of thought and religion, rather than
having natural allies in all other belief systems, have natural enemies in those
systems, as whenever a belief thinks it can win, it doesn't see any value in protecting
its competition. Well-kept gardens die by paciﬁsm, and the universalist liberal order
failed to maintain moral supremacy.

My personal response to this has mostly been to withdraw; if society doesn't want me
to speak my unfettered thoughts, then I shall fetter myself; I'm cooperative enough
for that, at least. If various traits that make me a good thinker make me unﬁt for
public service, then I will do other things instead. If various policies that are
downstream of careful thinking are highly unpopular, then I will not put my trust or
eﬀort into politics. There's a lot of Galt in this, where society gets what it rewards, and
it's up to society to learn to reward the right things.
Success lies in being secretive, and defeat lies in revealing things— an
enlightened lord will have none of this attitude. Success lies in being outspoken,
and defeat lies in hiding things— a benighted lord will have none of this attitude.
Thus, if the lord of men is secretive, then dishonest words will come, and straight
talk will be turned back. Petty men will draw near, and gentlemen will be put at a
distance. If the lord of men is outspoken, then straight talk will come, and
dishonest words will be turned back. Gentlemen will draw near, and petty men will
be put at a distance. --Xunzi, "Undoing Fixation"
There's a trope in Confucian thinking, which is that in times of trouble, where there are
no good people to serve, the best people--to the Confucians, the most morally upright-
-will retreat into obscurity, and wait for better times.[5] This seems to both be a purity
thing and a self-preservation thing; an honest man cannot serve a dishonest regime
without losing his honesty, and while a wicked minister might trouble a local merchant
for taxes or bribes, they would plot to kill another minister in their way. It is unhealthy
to be an honest man in a dishonest organization, and so the thing for the honest men
to do is become simple scholars or craftsmen or merchants.
And yet, the Dagny in my heart is not so willing to give up. Without people who look at
a wicked world and say "I will stand up for goodness," how could the world have any
goodness in it?
I must come to the topic of "selling" new ideas. You must master three things to
do this:
1. Giving formal presentations.
2. Producing written reports, and
3. Mastering the art of informal presentations as they happen to occur.
All three are essential--you must learn to sell your ideas, not by propaganda, but
by force of clear presentation. I am sorry to have to point this out; many scientists
and others think good ideas will win out automatically and need not be carefully
presented. They are wrong; many a good idea has had to be rediscovered because
it was not well presented the ﬁrst time, years before! New ideas are automatically
resisted by the establishment, and to some extent justly. --Richard Hamming, "The
Art of Doing Science and Engineering -- Learning to Learn"
And most of all, I ﬁnd myself wondering what the missing third way is. Presumably one
can serve two masters, and exist in both physical and social reality, and Bayesians
can win against barbarians; what does it look like to actually defend the
Enlightenment and liberal virtues against encroaching illiberalism? That is, could there
be a successful open campaign in the daylight that was in favor of reason and nerds?
(And the real deal, instead of "I fucking love science" sloganeering and Hollywood
nerds?)

And if not, then what? Will free thought simply fade into obscurity? Will someone
make one (or several?) modern Gulchs, where an open society of the mind can exist
by being a closed society of the body?[6] Will there just be whispers in the dark, where
free thinkers ﬁnd each other outside of the spotlight?

"Can you keep this conﬁdential? How
do you know?"
Pet peeve about privacy: I think people are woefully inadequate at asking, and
answering, "Can you keep this conﬁdential?"
Disclosure: I am not inherently great at keeping information private. By default, if a
topic came up in conversation, I would accidentally sometimes say my thoughts
before I had time to realize "oh, right, this was private information I shouldn't share."
I've worked over the past few years to become better at this - I've learned several
speciﬁc skills and habits that make it easier. But I didn't learn those skills in school,
and no one even really suggested I was supposed to learn them. People seemed to
just assume "people can keep secrets, and it's low cost for them to do so."
And... maybe this is just me. But, people say to me "hey, can you keep this private?",
in a tone that implies I'm not really supposed to say no. And that's the best case. I've
also observed things like...
...people saying "hey, this is conﬁdential", and then just saying the thing without
checking in.
...people saying "sign this NDA", without really checking I have the skills to honor that
agreement, and if I were to not sign, I'd... probably get ﬁred? Unclear.
...people gathering for a Circle or other private safe space, and saying (best case) "do
we all agree to keep things here conﬁdential? Raise you hand?" and worst case, just
ﬂatly asserting "This is a safe space, things are conﬁdential here". (And I have seen at
least one instance where someone I actively trusted later betrayed that trust)
...people saying "You can report things to our [org / HR department / point-person],
and they will keep things conﬁdential." But, I know that in the hiring process for that
org or department, no one ever checked that people actually had privacy skills.
And meanwhile, I have almost never heard anyone say something like "I have been
given 10 bits of private-info over the past few years, and I accidentally leaked two of
them", or even "I have paid any attention at all to how leaky I am with regards to
conﬁdential information."
What is a secret, even?
Meanwhile, people seem to vary in what they even mean by "secret" or "private
information." Some people take them as serious oaths, some people just kinda sorta
try to keep the R0 of the info lower than 1. Sometimes it seems to mean "carry this
information to your grave", and sometimes it means "I dunno keep this on the down-
low for awhile until the current controversy blows over."
Some people reading this might be surprised this is even a big deal. I gave a lightning-
talk version of this blogpost last weekend, and one person asked "does this really
matter that much, outside of major company NDAs or state-secrets?" Another person
expressed similar skepticism. 

I think it varies. The problem is exactly that most of the time, secrets aren't that big of
a deal. But people don't seem to take time to get on the same page of exactly how big
a deal they are, which is a recipe for mismatched expectations. 
It's a bigger deal for me, because I live in social and professional circles adjacent to EA
Grantmaking where line between the personal and professional is (perhaps
unfortunately) a bit blurry. Sometimes, I talk to people exploring ideas that are legit
infohazardous. Sometimes, people are hesitant to talk because they're worried it may
aﬀect their career. 
It's also important to me from a Robust Agency standpoint - I'd like to be a reliable
agent that people can coordinate with in complicated domains. Many other people in
the x-risk ecosystem also seem interested in that. I think "the ability to exchange
information, or reliably not exchange it" is a key skill, and worth cultivating because it
enables higher order strategies.
What to do with all this?
I don't have a clear next action with all this. Right now, there's a vague social norm
that you're supposed to be able to keep secrets, and that certain types of information
tend to be private-by-default, but outside of things like "your social security number",
there's not much agreement on what.
What I've personally taken to doing is giving myself a TAP, where as soon as I notice
that a conversation or relationship is moving in the direction where someone might
want to give me private information (or vice versa), I say "hey, I'd like to have a little
meta-discussion about privacy."
And then we have a chat. If the conversation literally just broached the idea that one
of us share private info, I try to avoid face-to-face contact to avoid micro-expressions
revealing information. (Someone else recently suggested leaving more pauses in the
conversation, so that reaction-time didn't reveal information either). 
Then, I ask some questions like:
Can you keep a secret?
How do you know?
What exactly do you mean by secret?
Meanwhile, acknowledging: "Hey, so, in the past few years I've leaked at least one
important bit of private-info. I haven't kept track of how much private info I didn't leak.
But, I've also been working on gaining skills that make me more reliable at keeping
things private, and making it lower cost for myself to take on conﬁdential information.
I'm fairly conﬁdent I can keep things private if I have to, but it's still a moderate cost
to myself and I have to choose to do it on purpose. So please don't assume I'm
keeping anything private unless I've speciﬁcally told you so."
I think it'd be good if such meta-conversations became more common. 
I think they most importantly should be common if you are creating an organization
that relies a lot on conﬁdentiality. If you're promising to your clients that their
information is private, but you aren't actually checking that your employees can keep

conﬁdence, you're creating integrity debt for yourself. You will need to pay it down
sooner or later. 
This is (hopefully) the ﬁrst post in the Privacy Practices sequences. The next post will
(probably) be "Parameters of Privacy."

Developmental Stages of GPTs
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than usual.
Epistemic Status: I only know as much as anyone else in my reference class (I build ML
models, I can grok the GPT papers, and I don't work for OpenAI or a similar lab). But I think
my thesis is original.
Related: Gwern on GPT-3
For the last several years, I've gone around saying that I'm worried about transformative AI,
an AI capable of making an Industrial Revolution sized impact (the concept is agnostic on
whether it has to be AGI or self-improving), because I think we might be one or two cognitive
breakthroughs away from building one.
GPT-3 has made me move up my timelines, because it makes me think we might need zero
more cognitive breakthroughs, just more reﬁnement / eﬃciency / computing power:
basically, GPT-6 or GPT-7 might do it. My reason for thinking this is comparing GPT-3 to GPT-
2, and reﬂecting on what the diﬀerences say about the "missing pieces" for transformative
AI.
My Thesis:
The diﬀerence between GPT-2 and GPT-3 has made me suspect that there's a
legitimate comparison to be made between the scale of a network architecture
like the GPTs, and some analogue of "developmental stages" of the resulting
network. Furthermore, it's plausible to me that the functions needed to be a
transformative AI are covered by a moderate number of such developmental
stages, without requiring additional structure. Thus GPT-N would be a
transformative AI, for some not-too-large N, and we need to redouble our eﬀorts
on ways to align such AIs. 
The thesis doesn't strongly imply that we'll reach transformative AI via GPT-N especially
soon; I have wide uncertainty, even given the thesis, about how large we should expect N to
be, and whether the scaling of training and of computation slows down progress before then.
But it's also plausible to me now that the timeline is only a few years, and that no
fundamentally diﬀerent approach will succeed before then. And that scares me.
Architecture and Scaling
GPT, GPT-2, and GPT-3 use nearly the same architecture; each paper says as much, with a
sentence or two about minor improvements to the individual transformers. Model size (and
the amount of training computation) is really the only diﬀerence.
GPT took 1 petaﬂop/s-day to train 117M parameters, GPT-2 took 10 petaﬂop/s-days to train
1.5B parameters, and the largest version of GPT-3 took 3,000 petaﬂop/s-days to train 175B
parameters. By contrast, AlphaStar seems to have taken about 30,000 petaﬂop/s-days of
training in mid-2019, so the pace of AI research computing power projects that there should
be about 10x that today. The upshot is that OpenAI may not be able to aﬀord it, but if Google
really wanted to make GPT-4 this year, they could aﬀord to do so.
Analogues to Developmental Stages

There are all sorts of (more or less well-deﬁned) developmental stages for human beings:
image tracking, object permanence, vocabulary and grammar, theory of mind, size and
volume, emotional awareness, executive functioning, et cetera.
I was ﬁrst reminded of developmental stages a few years ago, when I saw the layers of
abstraction generated in this feature visualization tool for GoogLeNet.
We don't have feature visualization for language models, but we do have generative outputs.
And as you scale up an architecture like GPT, you see higher levels of abstraction. Grammar
gets mastered, then content (removing absurd but grammatical responses), then tone (ﬁrst
rough genre, then spookily accurate authorial voice). Topic coherence is mastered ﬁrst on the
phrase level, then the sentence level, then the paragraph level. So too with narrative ﬂow.
Gwern's poetry experiments (GPT-2, GPT-3) are good examples. GPT-2 could more or less
continue the meter of a poem and use words that ﬁt the existing theme, but even its best
eﬀorts can get stuck in topic loops:
...Methinks I see her in her blissful dreams: 
—Or, fancy-like, in some mirage she lies, 
Majestic yet majestic, and of seems 
The image of the unconquerable skies. 
Methinks I see her in her blissful dreams: 
—Or, fancy-like, in some majestic cell, 
Where lordly seraphs strew their balmy dreams 
On the still night, or in their golden shell.
Or:
In the dark the sun doth gleam, 
And in the dark the moon doth seem 
But now the evening is begun— 
Gone is the sun upon the earth! 
The silver moon doth like a cup 
Of blood-red wine, and as that cup 
Is drained of life, doth quench no drop. 
What man will drink such wine?
GPT-3, though, has the sense of going somewhere, at least on the topic level. (Prompts in
bold.)
O time thy pyramids, thy palaces forgot, 
Pensive through nations wander with no more state 

Than in thy days, when wandering was thy trade: 
Mourn for Patraos, for the glory ﬂed 
Of him and thee, and in their stead left, left 
To other eyes a length of rolling sand, 
And such memorials as the traveller reads, 
Half guessed in shade, of sculptured walls half round, 
And long-defaced metopes, and friezes old.
[EDIT: Previously I also included its completion of a famous Emily Dickinson poem here, but
as benkuhn pointed out, GPT-3 had simply memorized the poem and recited it. I'm really
embarrassed, and also kind of shocked that I looked at the actual text of "Because I could
not stop for Death" and thought, "yup, that looks like something GPT-3 could produce".]
(One last shocking bit is that, while GPT-2 had to be ﬁne-tuned by taking the general model
and training it some more on a poetry-only dataset, you're seeing what GPT-3's model does
with no ﬁne-tuning, with just a prompt that sounds poetic!)
Similarly, GPT-3's ability to write ﬁction is impressive- unlike GPT-2, it doesn't lose track of
the plot, it has sensible things happen, it just can't plan its way to a satisfying resolution.
I'd be somewhat surprised if GPT-4 shared that last problem.
What's Next?
How could one of the GPTs become a transformative AI, even if it becomes a better and
better imitator of human prose style? Sure, we can imagine it being used maliciously to auto-
generate targeted misinformation or things of that sort, but that's not the real risk I'm
worrying about here.
My real worry is that causal inference and planning are starting to look more and
more like plausible developmental stages that GPT-3 is moving towards, and that
these were exactly the things I previously thought were the obvious obstacles between
current AI paradigms and transformative AI.
Learning causal inference from observations doesn't seem qualitatively diﬀerent from
learning arithmetic or coding from examples (and not only is GPT-3 accurate at adding three-
digit numbers, but apparently at writing JSX code to spec), only more complex in degree.
One might claim that causal inference is harder to glean from language-only data than from
direct observation of the physical world, but that's a moot point, as OpenAI are using the
same architecture to learn how to infer the rest of an image from one part.
Planning is more complex to assess. We've seen GPTs ascend from coherence of the next few
words, to the sentence or line, to the paragraph or stanza, and we've even seen them write
working code. But this can be done without planning; GPT-3 may simply have a good enough
distribution over next words to prune out those that would lead to dead ends. (On the other
hand, how sure are we that that's not the same as planning, if planning is just pruning on a
high enough level of abstraction?)
The bigger point about planning, though, is that the GPTs are getting feedback on one word
at a time in isolation. It's hard for them to learn not to paint themselves into a corner. It
would make training more ﬁnicky and expensive if we expanded the time horizon of the loss
function, of course. But that's a straightforward way to get the seeds of planning, and surely
there are other ways.
With causal modeling and planning, you have the capability of manipulation without external
malicious use. And the really worrisome capability comes when it models its own interactions
with the world, and makes plans with that taken into account.

Could GPT-N turn out aligned, or at least
harmless?
GPT-3 is trained simply to predict continuations of text. So what would it actually optimize
for, if it had a pretty good model of the world including itself and the ability to make plans in
that world?
One might hope that because it's learning to imitate humans in an unsupervised way, that it
would end up fairly human, or at least act in that way. I very much doubt this, for the
following reason:
Two humans are fairly similar to each other, because they have very similar
architectures and are learning to succeed in the same environment.
Two convergently evolved species will be similar in some ways but not others, because
they have diﬀerent architectures but the same environmental pressures.
A mimic species will be similar in some ways but not others to the species it mimics,
because even if they share recent ancestry, the environmental pressures on the
poisonous one are diﬀerent from the environmental pressures on the mimic.
What we have with the GPTs is the ﬁrst deep learning architecture we've found that scales
this well in the domain (so, probably not that much like our particular architecture), learning
to mimic humans rather than growing in an environment with similar pressures. Why should
we expect it to be anything but very alien under the hood, or to continue acting human once
its actions take us outside of the training distribution?
Moreover, there may be much more going on under the hood than we realize; it may take
much more general cognitive power to learn and imitate the patterns of humans, than it
requires us to execute those patterns.
Next, we might imagine GPT-N to just be an Oracle AI, which we would have better hopes of
using well. But I don't expect that an approximate Oracle AI could be used safely with
anything like the precautions that might work for a genuine Oracle AI. I don't know what
internal optimizers GPT-N ends up building along the way, but I'm not going to count on there
being none of them .
I don't expect that GPT-N will be aligned or harmless by default. And if N isn't that large
before it gets transformative capacity, that's simply terrifying.
What Can We Do?
While the short timeline suggested by the thesis is very bad news from an AI safety
readiness perspective (less time to come up with better theoretical approaches), there is one
silver lining: it at least reduces the chance of a hardware overhang. A project or coalition can
feasibly wait and take a better-aligned approach that uses 10x the time and expense of an
unaligned approach, as long as they have that amount of resource advantage over any
competitor. 
Unfortunately, the thesis also makes it less likely that a fundamentally diﬀerent architecture
will reach transformative status before something like GPT does.
I don't want to take away from MIRI's work (I still support them, and I think that if the GPTs
peter out, we'll be glad they've been continuing their work), but I think it's an essential time
to support projects that can work for a GPT-style near-term AGI, for instance by incorporating
speciﬁc alignment pressures during training. Intuitively, it seems as if Cooperative Inverse
Reinforcement Learning or AI Safety via Debate or Iterated Ampliﬁcation are in this class.

We may also want to do a lot of work on how better to mold a GPT-in-training into the shape
of an Oracle AI.
It would also be very useful to build some GPT feature "visualization" tools ASAP.
In the meantime, uh, enjoy AI Dungeon, I guess?

Alignment As A Bottleneck To
Usefulness Of GPT-3
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
So there's this thing where GPT-3 is able to do addition, it has the internal model to do
addition, but it takes a little poking and prodding to actually get it to do addition.
"Few-shot learning", as the paper calls it. Rather than prompting the model with
Q: What is 48 + 76? A:
... instead prompt it with
Q: What is 48 + 76? A: 124
Q: What is 34 + 53? A: 87
Q: What is 29 + 86? A:
The same applies to lots of other tasks: arithmetic, anagrams and spelling correction,
translation, assorted benchmarks, etc. To get GPT-3 to do the thing we want, it helps
to give it a few examples, so it can "ﬁgure out what we're asking for".
This is an alignment problem. Indeed, I think of it as the quintessential alignment
problem: to translate what-a-human-wants into a speciﬁcation usable by an AI. The
hard part is not to build a system which can do the thing we want, the hard part is to
specify the thing we want in such a way that the system actually does it.
The GPT family of models are trained to mimic human writing. So the prototypical
"alignment problem" on GPT is prompt design: write a prompt such that actual human
writing which started with that prompt would likely contain the thing you actually
want. Assuming that GPT has a suﬃciently powerful and accurate model of human
writing, it should then generate the thing you want.
Viewed through that frame, "few-shot learning" just designs a prompt by listing some
examples of what we want - e.g. listing some addition problems and their answers.
Call me picky, but that seems like a rather primitive way to design a prompt. Surely
we can do better?
Indeed, people are already noticing clever ways to get better results out of GPT-3 -
e.g. TurnTrout recommends conditioning on writing by smart people, and the right
prompt makes the system complain about nonsense rather than generating further
nonsense in response. I expect we'll see many such insights over the next month or
so.
Capabilities vs Alignment as Bottleneck to
Value

I said that the alignment problem on GPT is prompt design: write a prompt such that
actual human writing which started with that prompt would likely contain the thing
you actually want. Important point: this is worded to be agnostic to the details GPT
algorithm itself; it's mainly about predictive power. If we've designed a good prompt,
the current generation of GPT might still be unable to solve the problem - e.g. GPT-3
doesn't understand long addition no matter how good the prompt, but some future
model with more predictive power should eventually be able to solve it.
In other words, there's a clear distinction between alignment and capabilities:
alignment is mainly about the prompt, and asks whether human writing which
started with that prompt would be likely to contain the thing you want
capabilities are mainly about GPT's model, and ask about how well GPT-
generated writing matches realistic human writing
Interesting question: between alignment and capabilities, which is the main
bottleneck to getting value out of GPT-like models, both in the short term and the
long(er) term?
In the short term, it seems like capabilities are still pretty obviously the main
bottleneck. GPT-3 clearly has pretty limited "working memory" and understanding of
the world. That said, it does seem plausible that GPT-3 could consistently do at least
some economically-useful things right now, with a carefully designed prompt - e.g.
writing ad copy or editing humans' writing.
In the longer term, though, we have a clear path forward for better capabilities. Just
continuing along the current trajectory will push capabilities to an economically-
valuable point on a wide range of problems, and soon. Alignment, on the other hand,
doesn't have much of a trajectory at all yet; designing-writing-prompts-such-that-
writing-which-starts-with-the-prompt-contains-the-thing-you-want isn't exactly a hot
research area. There's probably low-hanging fruit there for now, and it's largely
unclear how hard the problem will be going forward.
Two predictions on this front:
With this version of GPT and especially with whatever comes next, we'll start to
see a lot more eﬀort going into prompt design (or the equivalent alignment
problem for future systems)
As the capabilities of GPT-style models begin to cross beyond what humans can
do (at least in some domains), alignment will become a much harder bottleneck,
because it's hard to make a human-mimicking system do things which humans
cannot do
Reasoning for the ﬁrst prediction: GPT-3 is right on the borderline of making alignment
economically valuable - i.e. it's at the point where there's plausibly some immediate
value to be had by ﬁguring out better ways to write prompts. That means there's
ﬁnally going to be economic pressure for alignment - there's going to be ways to make
money by coming up with better alignment tricks. That won't necessarily mean
economic pressure for generalizable or robust alignment tricks, though - most of the
economy runs on ad-hoc barely-good-enough tricks most of the time, and early
alignment tricks will likely be the same. In the longer run, focus will shift toward more
robust alignment, as the low-hanging problems are solved and the remaining
problems have most of their value in the long tail.

Reasoning for the second prediction: how do I write a prompt such that human writing
which began with that prompt would contain a workable explanation of a cheap fusion
power generator? In practice, writing which claims to contain such a thing is generally
crackpottery. I could take a diﬀerent angle, maybe write some section-headers with
names of particular technologies (e.g. electric motor, radio antenna, water pump, ...)
and descriptions of how they work, then write a header for "fusion generator" and let
the model ﬁll in the description. Something like that could plausibly work. Or it could
generate sciﬁ technobabble, because that's what would be most likely to show up in
such a piece of writing today. It all depends on which is "more likely" to appear in
human writing. Point is: GPT is trained to mimic human writing; getting it to write
things which humans cannot currently write is likely to be hard, even if it has the
requisite capabilities.

Situating LessWrong in contemporary
philosophy: An interview with Jon
Livengood
Jonathan Livengood is a current associate professor of philosophy at Urbana-
Champaign, who hung around the ﬁrst iteration of LessWrong in the late 2000s and
early 2010s as a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, where he was
writing a dissertation on causal inference under John Norton, Peter Spirtes, and
Edouard Machery. He also blogs at the excellent Unshielded Colliders.
One of the central criticisms of mainstream philosophy at LessWrong has always been
aimed at its tendency (sometimes called "conceptual analysis") to reify cognitive
concepts ir linguistic terms—to perceive them, in other words, as having a simple,
one-to-one correspondence with regularities or features of the world (see "Taboo Your
Words," "Concepts Don't Work That Way," "LessWrong Rationality and Mainstream
Philosophy"). Livengood and I discuss the state of conceptual analysis in philosophy
departments, and its recent replacement by "conceptual engineering." We also
discuss some of the problems of academic philosophy, continuities between
LessWrong and analytic thought, and the status of insights like Bayesianism,
veriﬁcationism, the pragmatist motto "making beliefs pay rent," and Korzybski's "map
and territory."
Some context for this interview can be found in an earlier post, "Conceptual
engineering: The revolution in philosophy you've never heard of," as well as in short
pieces on my personal blog about LessWrong vs. contemporary philosophy (1, 2). But
I'll add some deﬁnitions up front, to give context to our conversation for those who
haven't read the backlog:
conceptual analysis: a method of philosophy in which a concept is assumed to have
necessary and suﬃcient criteria which can be described simply and robustly; for
instance, there might be a set of criteria which elegantly compress and describe all
native-speaker utterances of a concept like "truth." Typically, a philosophical opponent
will rebut a proposed set of criteria by oﬀering counterexamples: cases in which a use-
case of a concept does not meet the proposed criteria (or in which a non-member of
the conceptual does meet them). Michael Bishop's "The Possibility of Conceptual
Clarity in Philosophy" is an excellent, if skeptical, introduction.
conceptual engineering: a recently proposed shift in philosophical method, which
abandons the idea of concepts as having "necessary and suﬃcient" criteria, and
instead of analyzing concepts, attempts to rigorize or redeﬁne them so they can be
made more useful for a philosophical problem at hand.
This interview runs long, so I've supplied headers and bolded key lines which will
hopefully enable selecting browsing.
On conceptual analysis & the history of
philosophy

Livengood: [Before we start, since we're discussing LessWrong versus more
traditional philosophy...] It's not clear to me that there's any unique thing we could
think of as philosophy, full-stop, or "philosophical discourse today." I think a better
picture is there are a bunch of overlapping activities and pursuits; sometimes they
have goals that are nearby, and a lot of behavioral practice can live happily in any of
those circumstances, but the ends people have in mind are a little diﬀerent. We can
have a lot of shared discourse in philosophical spaces; we all go to the same
conferences and there isn't much disconnect, but when you try to get into what
exactly people are trying to do with these projects, it can come pretty far apart.
Reason: Well, perhaps one angle here—I've heard it argued that conceptual analysis
is the foundational, inseparable, aprioristic mode of philosophizing that goes back to
antiquity and forms a throughline from philosophy's past to present. And though it's
not always stated, the implication is that by turning a leaf from conceptual analysis to
conceptual engineering, you've fundamentally changed the nature of the ﬁeld: what it
thinks it's up to in terms of lexicography, how it understands deﬁnitions, its place in
oﬀering linguistic prescriptions versus descriptions, the factorings of concepts and
how people use them, and a larger transition from armchair philosophizing to the kind
of experimental, empirical work you're doing with causation. Does that sound like a
resonant narrative, or how oﬀ am I?
Livengood: I think that's a popular narrative. There's a fair amount of nuance that
gets trampled, but it's not a naive or amateurish view, there are philosophers I really
like, such as Stephen Stich, who would give more or less this account of the
development of Western philosophy. And you can deﬁnitely see elements of it in the
Platonic dialogues: Socrates shows up in the marketplace, and someone runs into him,
and they say something oﬀ the cuﬀ like, "So-and-so was really courageous yesterday,"
or Euthyphro says, "I'm doing the pious thing by prosecuting my father for murder."
And Socrates will go, "Oh. So you must know what courage, or piety is. Tell me about
that." The structure usually looks like the other person giving a cluster-type deﬁnition,
"Piety is when you do these sorts of thing—going to sacriﬁces, doing what the gods
require, visiting the temple on a regular basis." And then Socrates says, "no, I don't
want a list."
Reason: He wants the essence.
Livengood: Right, give me the account. And the other person realizes what Socrates
wants is a deﬁnition, so they give an attempt at a deﬁnition. Socrates gives a counter-
example, so they patch the deﬁnition; Socrates gives another counter-example and
they patch the deﬁnition; and eventually everyone gets tired and leaves. That's the
structure of a dialogue, especially the early ones.
There's something really nice about that format, and something that looks very similar
to even contemporary work. One of the corners of the literature I know fairly well, the
causation literature, a lot of it looks like that. Take David Lewis in the 1970s oﬀering a
counterfactual account of causation with a simple core idea: causation is like
counterfactual dependence of a certain sort, or some pair of counterfactual
dependence claims. And then people point out problems with that account, so he
oﬀers patches—in 1986, in 2000, another posthumously. There's a series of
counterexamples and revisions to try to capture the counterexamples, and this
process repeats and repeats. You wonder if the dialogue's gonna end in the same was
as the Platonic dialogues: eﬀectively people get bored with it, and move on, or if
there's something like a satisfactory theoretical resolution.

There's an interesting, diﬃcult, subtle kind of question about what the aims of that
procedure really are; you'd asked when you wrote me, you used the word
"lexicography" in your setup. I don't think for the most part philosophers have been
trying to do, or thought of themselves as doing, lexicography. It seems to me that
philosophers up until the 20th century, really, were doing one of two things. The
boring older thing is doing metaphysics, where the target is supposed to be a thing
"out there" in the world, and it's not so much that the project is ﬁguring out how we
use language, but about getting at whatever the thing is "out there." Think about this
the same way you think about scientiﬁc things, Newton and the apocryphal apple. You
say: "That thing we just saw, let's call that gravity; there are objects, and when they're
unsupported, they fall." What's the right account of that? We know what we're talking
about, we ﬁxed our reference, but now we want to give an account.
It seems to me like historically, philosophers were aiming at the same type of things.
You should think of Socrates as saying something like, "We've seen examples of what
we might call courage, or piety—there's a thing, out there in the world" and here I
think he's making a mistake, there's this abstract object "justice" or "piety" or
"courage," and that thing I want to give an account of in the same way I give an
account of gravity, or matter, or space.
Reason: The mistake being that he reiﬁes a cognitive cluster space of "the good" or
"the pious" as matching onto a discernible structure in the world, as opposed to being
a garbage heap humans have found useful to call "pious" historically. Do you think
philosophy that falls into that style of thought identiﬁes and corrects its mistakes
before Wittgenstein, or is Wittgenstein rightfully treated as a big deal in part for
noticing it?
Livengood: Wittgenstein is tricky in a few diﬀerent ways, and the 20th century on
this is... contentious. There are two related things that happened where, the history is
not so obvious yet, and so there are still live debates about how to think about it.
There's this movement of analytic philosophy, you'll see Frege get included, Russell
and Moore typically, Wittgenstein and maybe Carnap; sometimes the Ordinary
Language group will get picked up like Austin; but there's this core British group that's
tough to distinguish from realists.
Reason: They're rebelling from British idealism.
Livengood: And there's this focus on ﬁguring out the meaning of terms; this is a big
part of Russell's writing, for example; and there's a lot of concern with the logical
structure of speech. Then there's a related phenomenon—sometimes it's smooshed
together, sometimes they're separated—this idea of philosophical analysis, and this
related idea of the linguistic turn. A number of people think that sometime in the 20th
century there's a shift; often they're thinking of Carnap, who is very explicit about the
diﬀerence between a material kind of discourse, which is how I've described Socrates
—giving this account of a thing in the world, like piety—and another mode, Carnap's
formal mode, which is, treating this term that shows up in our language, "piety," now
with quotation marks. I'm talking about a linguistic object. And of course there's a
possible further shift to paying attention to our concepts, which are supposed to be
attached in some way to a linguistic term.
Reason: I guess one contention I'd advance is, to me, a classical account of concepts
as having necessary and suﬃcient criteria in the analytic mode is in some way
indistinguishable from the belief in forms or essences insofar as, even if you separate
the human concept from the thing in the world, if you advance that the human

concept has a low-entropy structure which can be described elegantly and robustly,
you're essentially also saying there's a real structure in the world which goes with it. If
you can deﬁne X, Y, & Z criteria, you have a pattern, and those analyses assume, if
you can describe a concept in a non-messy way, as having regularity, then you're
granting a certain Platonic reality to the concept; the pattern of regularity is a feature
of the world. I don't know, what do you think of that?
Livengood: There's a lot right about what you said, and the kinds of challenges you
see in the middle of the 20th century are serious problems for this whole collection of
approaches, but I think it's important to see that this kind of move, especially from
Carnap, which was preﬁgured a bit by what Russell was doing, was an important
advance because it didn't necessary reify the target of the inquiry. In some cases you
might want to say, "Gravity, that's something we can responsibly talk about as
existing in the world," but for other things, we might just want to talk about what our
language is doing. It might just be transactional—what kind of inferences we're going
to make, what linguistic acts we're gonna trade back and forth; it might not be
tracking anything out in the world. So there's been a pretty serious advance from the
picture you're getting from Socrates up through the 20th century, to when people
start focusing on the language, and thinking of linguistic acts or the structure of the
language as themselves the targets of the investigation.
Reason: It's hard to understand the history backwards; much of what past
philosophers got right now seems obvious, while everything non-obvious is wrong.
Livengood: I think that's right; one of the things that's fun about doing history
of philosophy is seeing how very smart people can be deeply confused about
things. They have an idea but it's vague and mashed-up, and today you'd say,
"You're running together six diﬀerent things, you have to pull apart and distinguish
them." It's a thing that happens a lot, reading the history.
Reason: If I want to learn about the history of philosophy, or what Kant thought, or
about philosophy through Kant—in which of these situations should I read the original,
and when should I read a secondary source?
Livengood: Secondary sources have huge virtues, and you've identiﬁed some of
them: they're often clearer than primary sources, they often supply intellectual
context and help situate the primary source, while drawing out what the ﬁeld thinks is
important. But there are also vices: the secondary literature may not be right about
what the most important things in the primary source are; often these sources are
idiosyncratic in their readings.
Reason: What's your gut on how good these secondary sources are? Let's say major
university press, respected in the ﬁeld. Have we pretty much mined everything in the
original, or are there gems still hiding out?
Livengood: The danger is more on the side of over-interpreting, or being
overly charitable to the target. I just wrapped up a grad seminar on the problem
of induction, and we were looking at the historical development of the problem of
induction from Hume to 1970. As I pointed out, when you look at Hume, Hume's great,
he's fun to read, but he's also deeply confused, and you don't want to do the
following, which is a mistake: If you start with the assumption that Hume was just
right, and assume that, if you're seeing an error it must be an error in your
interpretation—if that's your historiographical approach, you're not going to
understand Hume, you're going to understand this distorted SuperHume, who knows

all these things Hume didn't know, and can respond to subtle distinctions and
complaints that someone living now is able to formulate. That's not Hume! Hume
didn't have an atomic theory, he didn't know anything about DNA or evolution; there
are tons of things that were not on his radar. He's not making distinctions we'd want
him to make, that a competent philosopher today would make. There's a real danger
writing secondary literature, or generating new interpretations. If you want to
publish a book on Hume, you need to say something new, a new angle—
what's new and also responsible to what Hume wrote? It ends up doing new
philosophy under the guise of history. There I'm suspicious that there's anything new
to say that's also responsible to the writer.
In the 70s, the target for me is Quine; he wrote a paper called "Epistemology
Naturalized," and there's a straightforward reading of this paper where he's
resuscitating Hume, and giving a contemporary update. He has this throw-away line;
the slogan part is, "The Humean predicament is the human predicament," but he also
says, there hasn't been any progress in epistemology on the doctrinal side, the side
that's dealing with normative questions, questions of justiﬁcation, and the problem of
inductive reasoning, since Hume. So the seminar [I ran] was asking: Is Quine right? I
was upfront with the students, that there's been a lot of work on inferential problems
between 1970 and today; almost all the interesting work on causal inference is after
1970. You have the emergence of information criteria, lots of statistical techniques like
the bootstrap and jackknife, Bayesian and computational resources, machine learning
and big data—those all change the landscape.
Livengood's experience with LessWrong
Reason: I want to ask how you think of the historic state of philosophy, or what it
would be like to project a historical view on the present, but I want to ask about
LessWrong, so let's jump back and forth. How'd you get exposed to the community?
What was your experience?
Livengood: I started reading in the 2000s, I don't remember exactly which pieces.
Much of it was just self-reinforcing; for the most part, stuﬀ that happened on
LessWrong [then] seemed indistinguishable to me from high-level amateur, low-level
professional discourse in philosophy? Smart graduate students, people who had really
decent ideas but lacked the professional language to express it. That's the way the
LessWrong community struck me at the time; I was a graduate student just starting,
and it felt like, "Yeah! I'm having a conversation with other people doing the same
kind of thing I'm doing." There's sometimes an impression that the people on
LessWrong were doing something wildly out of step from what philosophers
would ordinarily think of themselves as doing, and that was not my
impression.
Reason: Both naysayers and advocates for LessWrong or Yudkowsky do often
emphasize the gap like you say, and I think unless you're very knowledgeable about
the ﬁeld, you hear a lot of bad arguments coming out of philosophy, both historically
and still today. (Sturgeon's Law.) And most philosophers worth their chops in these
ﬁelds are aware of these historical arguments being ﬂawed; they're maybe more
generous, and probably see these (today obvious) ideas as highly non-obvious in their
times.
Livengood: Again, the thing I said earlier, that there isn't "such a thing, fullstop" as
philosophy—LessWrong [at that time] seemed fruitfully engaged in similar kinds of

questions, concerns, and problems to at least some parts of contemporary academic
philosophy, and parts of contemporary philosophy I like and think are non-trivial. It's
not a ghettoized, small corner of philosophy; there are robust projects that are shared
by a number of departments across the world that do things this way.
I would agree LessWrong does things diﬀerently, there's a house style, but it's not like
the collection of theses they defend or are pursuing or developing are so far out of the
mainstream that academics wouldn't recognize it as philosophy, or as being
reasonable approaches to philosophy.
Romantic vs. professionalized philosophy
Reason: Well, that's why I reached out in the ﬁrst place; you'd left a comment on
Luke Muehlhauser's "Train Philosophers With Pearl and Kahneman, not Plato and Kant"
gesturing to this eﬀect—that at least in your graduate program, at Pittsburgh,
cognitive science was very paid-attention-to.
Livengood: The Pittsburgh scene is a little peculiar; just background-wise, at the
University of Pittsburgh there are two departments which at the time were on the
same ﬂoor. There's an enormous, 42-story cathedral of learning at Pittsburgh, lovely
neo-Gothic, built in the 30s, and these two departments were right across the hall:
there was the philosophy department, and there was the History and Philosophy of
Science (HPS) department. My PhD is from the latter.
Those departments are very diﬀerent in the way they think about what philosophy is
doing, the way they train their graduate students, the way their courses are
conducted, their faculty. Maybe the best way to describe that diﬀerence is there are
two divergent attitudes of how philosophy should go, what I'd describe as the
professionalized view and the romantic view. The HPS side tended to be more
professionalized; you ﬁnd an interesting problem, chip away at it, advance the ﬁeld a
bit, and at the end of a long career, you and the people you're working in conversation
with will have learned something, you'll have advanced human knowledge. This is the
way things have to go: most of us are not geniuses, we're just ordinary people
chipping away at a problem.
And then there's the romantic view that says look, the people we read and engage
with—Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, Wittgenstein—are these super-geniuses who thought
thoughts nobody else had ever thought before, who shook the foundations of human
knowledge and turned things upside down. This is the aim: to become one of those
people.
And the diﬀerence in graduate training in the two programs is, HPS you come in, write
some papers, get out in 6-8 years, get a job, everybody does that. The Pitt Philosophy
program you come, think some things, try to think the deep thoughts; the very best
people go on to an awesome career, the rest of you, well, we're happy to burn through
a hundred grad students to ﬁnd a diamond.
My sympathies are, as you might expect, entirely with the professionalized view.
Reason: It does seem if you're a Wittgenstein-level genius, you don't need your
romanticism stoked, you might not even a graduate program. Certainly they didn't.

Livengood: That's probably right, but to give the devil his due, there are things to
like, there are reasons people are attracted to that romantic view. They're just not
reasons I endorse at the end of the day.
Analytic communities on LessWrong's
wavelength
Reason: Have you read Clark Glymour's manifesto?
Livengood: Yes.
Reason: What did you think?
Livengood: So that's the other element in the mix. There are these two Pitt
departments, both quite good, the Philosophy program at the time was top ﬁve in the
world, and HPS program has been for a long time the place to do philosophy of
science. And then across the street is Carnegie Mellon, which, their philosophy
department is basically Glymour's construction. Whoever the president or provost was
recruited Clark out of Pitt to establish a philosophy department, and Glymour's like,
great, I can build a philosophy department from scratch, the way I'd want to run a
philosophy department. It's a peculiar place. The way I've heard it described is
that CMU's philosophy department is what you get when you treat
philosophy as a kind of engineering. I think that's not inaccurate. I happen to
think that's beautiful, a really good look for philosophy.
Reason: What would you call the CMU, HPS, maybe LSE, you can throw LessWrong in
there it sounds like—
Livengood: I would include also Irvine, University of Minnesota, Indiana University
sometimes has had this vibe. It's not quite positivist, but it's in that neighborhood—
science-friendly, professionalized, trying to make progress, caring about mathematics
and empiricism.
Reason: It's the kind of people who would've been positivists in the 50s.
Livengood: If Carnap were alive today he'd be in this camp. Whether he'd have the
views he had back then, well, he probably wouldn't; we learn things, we hope that
these things change minds.
Reason: I've heard this vibe is also popular in Europe.
Livengood: Yeah, the LMU at Munich has the same kind of character. European
programs are trickier because much of it is tied to local funding regimes, but there do
seem to be more of these mathematically, empirically informed projects.
Reason: A popular metaphor at LessWrong is Korzybski's "map and the territory,"
though it may have gotten there via Hayakawa. Is it a good metaphor, or do its
reductions actually set you back, as some detractors claim?
Livengood: I think I'm mostly a fan of the Korzybski metaphor. It's serviceable. I think
it has some limitations where the map is the territory, which can happen when the
map-making makes the thing. Here I'm thinking of pretty mundane cases, like how
something being money depends on how we treat it, and also more controversial

cases, like the construction of gender and race or the status of mathematical objects.
Or do you think that misses the point of the metaphor?
Reason: Bayes, underrated, overrated?
Livengood: Hm... a bit of both. Bayesian approaches in philosophy of science and
epistemology today are pretty standard. Bayesian analysis of scientiﬁc reasoning is a
project that's probably overrated, at least in philosophy. Bayes in undergraduate
education generally is probably underrated; I teach a 100-level intro to logic course,
and I tell the students, if you take a Stats 100 class, you'll see frequentist approaches
to probability, and frequentist statistical inference techniques, so I'm going to give you
something diﬀerent, give you a Bayesian take on it. So far I haven't yet have a
student saying, well, this is obviously the way people think about probability, this is
boring and I've seen it in my other classes.
Reason: We're obviously familiar with the idea of scientiﬁc progress. Ethics get
described surprisingly similarly, where there's a kind of drift; whether that drift
happens "on its own," in an inevitable ratchet, or whether people have to work to
make it happen, is unclear; but this is the way changing norms around race, sexuality,
animal rights get talked about typically. Do you feel like the shift that departments like
HPS or CMU are leading, the transition from conceptual analysis, will win out or
become dominant? How do you see the ﬁeld a hundred years out?
Livengood: Predictions that far out are tricky. It's not obvious to me we'll have
anything that look like contemporary universities in a hundred years. You asked over
email about technological developments and philosophical progress, and there are
lots of positive impacts there. Increases in massive online instruction, I'm not sure
how that will shake out.
Philosophy's role in public discourse
Reason: Last year you wrote, "I don't think philosophers are especially well-equipped
in virtue of their training to help out in the current crisis. We're more like high-trained
sports fencers when a general melee is breaking out. We've trained to participate in a
game that has speciﬁc restricted rules, that are implicit and often hard to fathom; if
we go out into the world and try to ﬁx it playing by our usual rules, the result will be
predictably bad." This seems right to me, but the question becomes, who is ﬁlling this
role? We don't have literal swordﬁghts, so it's not a big deal if human capital is
channeled into play-fencing. We do have these ﬁgurative swordﬁghts though, so the
question becomes, who is ﬁlling this role in public discourse?
Livengood: I thought your list was pretty good. [I'd emailed along Tyler Cowen's
comments that amateurs in philosophy are running the public-facing discipline: Silicon
Valley stoicism, Nicholas Nassim Taleb, LessWrong-style rationalism and post-
rationalism, ex-New Atheists like Sam Harris, psychologists like Jordan Peterson.] It
gets ﬁlled in a variety of a way, some by professional or near-professional
philosophers by way of podcasts, but much of it in larger circuits are indeed ﬁlled by
people like Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, and then even less interesting people like Ben
Shapiro.
Reason: Zizek seems like one of the few entries from a more traditional philosophy
tradition.

Livengood: Yeah, there are a few outliers. Peter Singer has had a fair amount of
popular public impact. There are other with marginal public inﬂuence, but who are
clearly important, such as Martha Nussbaum or Dan Dennett. They matter, even if
they're not nearly as visible as people like Zizek, or Chomsky, or Singer. I don't know
how many public-facing philosophers we need in a society of this size; it does seem
like, given that I'm not especially impressed by people like Harris and Peterson and
Shapiro, we could use more public-facing philosophy—but there's also a question
of why it is the market has taken up those individuals, whether there are
just market-type demands that are satisﬁed by the ideas they're producing
that wouldn't take up public bandwidth the way more mainline philosophical
production would.
Reason: Looking to one historical precedent, what do you think of say the post-war
French gang, Sartre through Foucault? That's a case of borderline public hysteria
around a set of more-or-less traditional academic philosophers. Is that fair? What can
we take away, what do we learn?
Livengood: I'm not sure we learn anything. I'm not a radical contingency historian, I
don't think there's nothing to learn from history, but there are often events where
there isn't much to take away, you have a couple interesting public intellectual ﬁgures
who happen to be in philosophy, who happen to have a public who is interested in
their ideas; if they'd been in a diﬀerent ﬁeld, would things have been diﬀerent? I don't
know. The counterfactuals make me think it's too hard to judge. At minimum, we'd
need a whole lot more detailed information about their writing, what was going on in
society, and I'm unqualiﬁed for that.
Selection and referee problems in philosophy
Reason: I've really appreciated how much personality philosophy has. You have
Chalmers and his Zombie Blues band, the Kripkensteins, it's a fun wonky ﬁeld, old
men with big personalities and big beards, I'm a big fan. But now that I've said
something nice about philosophy I have to say something mean. Sturgeon's Law says
90% of any ﬁeld is bad, 10% is good; you have plenty of dressed-up, garbage literary
ﬁction and plenty of brilliant pulpy sci-ﬁ books. Do you think there's a mechanism that
makes it more diﬃcult for the ﬁeld to sort out and identify the good among the bad?
Maybe it takes a certain level of criticality to identify the good thought to begin with,
and the implicit consensuses built oﬀ support and textual elaboration aren't guiding us
to the correct answers.
Livengood: Part of what you're saying sounds right, but I'm a little nervous about
other bits. I'd put it in terms of "rules for settling opinions": in the sciences, there are
clear standards for settling disputes, where you work out an experiment and run it. I'm
not naive about how the sciences work in reality, but in principle at least, if you have a
disagreement, you can come to an agreement about what you will do or believe in
light of the experiment you're going to run. This is an idealistic Feynman picture, that
at the end of the day, if you run the experiment, and the experiment doesn't agree
with your idea, even if your idea is super pretty, it's wrong. In real scientiﬁc practice
it's a lot messier, but in philosophy it's much harder to agree on a constraint or rule
for settling disputes. We have practices we engage in, and we do tend to move closer
together in the process of extended discourse and argument, but it's hard to say why
that happens; I ﬁnd it very unsettling that I don't a good sense of what might resolve a
disagreement. It's a problem I'm always puzzling about.

There's something I want to fuss about though. It seems to me that philosophy has a
bad cultural ﬁxation on the genius, but that a lot of progress is possible in philosophy
without these super-genius-level contributors. This is part of my bias toward the
professionalized way of looking at the ﬁeld. I think the best work in philosophy is
identifying a narrow topic you can actually make progress on, and chipping away at it
through formal precision, distinctions, experiments, and collectively we make progress
on these problems. It's not always obvious that there's progress, or what progress
looks like, when you're too close to it, or it's really new, but if you give yourself an
extended period—how people have thought about induction from Hume to today—
you'll see lots of progress made.
Making beliefs pay rent
Reason: I can't let you go before asking about Peirce, who you've written quite a bit
about. One of the views of his that surfaces on LessWrong is a demand that beliefs
pay rent. Now, I know people make a lot of the diﬀerences between pragmatism and
positivism, and certainly Russell hated the pragmatists, but there seems to be a kernel
or core, maybe you could call it weak veriﬁcationism, where if one person believes
one thing, and another believes another thing, then there should be some observable
diﬀerence that matters, something that ought to tell us who is right our wrong. That if
there's nothing in the world that can distinguish between our arguments, maybe we're
not in disagreement at all. Veriﬁcationism proper comes under a lot of ﬂack these
days; maybe you can suggest a better handle for the rough, generic version I'm
describing; but I'm curious, is veriﬁcationism a good idea that's needed a lot of
qualiﬁcation over the 20th C, or is it a bad idea that got us oﬀ on the wrong foot?
Livengood: I think it's a great idea that's mostly right. It's similar to what we were
talking about with primary and secondary sources: the bulk of its value lies in pretty
simple statements, even though those statements aren't quite right. They have
counterexamples, or haven't had enough detail built into them, but you get the gist.
It's still an open question as to whether an adequate account of the
veriﬁcation criterion can be made to work, but I'm not sure it really matters
with respect to the practical service the idea performs. Something like Peirce's
pragmatic maxim, or various Positivist views, or the veriﬁcationism Quine goes in for—
all of those are quite salutary attitudes to have. Broadly good, broadly healthy, and
they inspire broadly good practices in our intellectual lives.
Now, when you start trying to narrow it down to a dogmatic thesis, then I'm not so
sure a veriﬁcationist account of meaning is going to quite work. There are some
obvious failures; A.J. Ayers' account doesn't work, it's pretty easy to kill it, and Church
gives devastating counterexamples.
Reason: If we cast Ayers as a conceptual engineer, isn't he just telling us what a
meaningful sentence is?
Livengood: Yes! This is more or less the Carnapian route. Carnap's accounts have not
been knocked over in the way Ayers has been.
Reason: Well, I'll just ask a couple minutes more of your time: One paper I've gotten a
lot out of is Michael Bishop's 1992, "The Possibility of Conceptual Clarity in
Philosophy." He talks about a "counterexample" style of philosophizing that's broader
than conceptual analysis, where the philosopher sits in the ﬁgurative armchair,
proposes a deﬁnition, and another armchair-occupant posits a counterexample which

pokes a hole in the original proposal. Much like a Socratic dialogue. Given this has
been the standard method for both proposing and rejecting proposals, it seems that, if
we grant prototype theory and reject classical accounts of concept—if we believe
concepts are fuzzy and polysemous; that there will always be edge-cases to a
conceptual carving, and there's no way to losslessly compress into a few simple
criteria the high entropy use-in-the-world by millions of decentralized speakers over
time—if we grant this about concepts, should we let the classically analytic rulings
from the 20th C about what is "meaningful" or "true" or "knowledge" stand? Ought we
revisit those debates to see if they might be useful factorings, even if they aren't
necessary and suﬃcient?
Livengood: Yes. The best example I can give is work by Joseph Halpern, a computer
scientist at Cornell. He's got a couple really interesting books, one on knowledge one
on causation, and big parts of what he's doing are informed by the long history of
conceptual analysis. He'll go through the puzzles, show a formalization, but then does
a further thing, which philosophers need to take very seriously and should do more
often. He says, look, I have this core idea, but to deploy it I need to know the problem
domain. The shape of the problem domain may put additional constraints on the
mathematical, precise version of the concept. I might need to tweak the core idea in a
way that makes it look unusual, relative to ordinary language, so that it can excel in
the problem domain. And you can see how he's making use of this long history
of case-based, conceptual analysis-friendly approach, and also the
pragmatist twist: that you need to be thinking relative to a problem, you
need to have a constraint which you can optimize for, and this tells you what
it means to have a right or wrong answer to a question. It's not so much free-
form ﬁtting of intuitions, built from ordinary language, but the solving of a speciﬁc
problem.

Classifying games like the Prisoner's
Dilemma
Note: the math and the picture didn't transfer. I may try to ﬁx it in future, but for now you
might want to just read it at the original site . [Mod/Edit note: Should all be ﬁxed now!]
Consider games with the following payoﬀ matrix:
 
 
 Player 2 
 
 
 
 
Krump
Flitz
Player 1 Krump ( W , W )
( X , Y  )
 
Flitz
( Y  , X )
( Z , Z )
One such game is the Prisoner's Dilemma (in which strategy "Krump" is usually called
"Cooperate", and "Flitz" is usually called "Defect"). But the Prisoner's Dilemma has additional
structure. Speciﬁcally, to qualify as a PD, we must have Y > W > Z > X. Y > W gives the
motivation to defect if the other player cooperates, and Z > X gives that motivation if the
other player defects. With these two constraints, the Nash equilibrium is always going to be
Flitz/Flitz for a payoﬀ of (Z, Z). W > Z is what gives the dilemma its teeth; if instead Z > W,
then that equilibrium is a perfectly ﬁne outcome, possibly the optimal one.
I usually think of a Prisoner's Dilemma as also having 2W > X + Y > 2Z. That speciﬁes that
mutual cooperation has the highest total return - it's "socially optimal" in a meaningful
sense1 - while mutual defection has the lowest. It also means you can model the "defect"
action as "take some value for yourself, but destroy value in the process". (Alternatively,
"cooperate" as "give some of your value to your playmate2, adding to that value in the
process".) We might consider instead:
If 2W < X + Y , then defecting while your playmate cooperates creates value (relative
to cooperating). From a social perspective, Krump/Flitz or Flitz/Krump is preferable to
Krump/Krump; and in an iterated game of this sort, you'd prefer to alternate X with Y
 than to get a constant W. Wikipedia still classes this as a Prisoner's Dilemma, but I
think that's dubious terminology, and I don't think it's standard. I might oﬀhand
suggest calling it the Too Many Cooks game. (This name assumes that you'd rather go
hungry than cook, and that spoiled broth is better than no broth.)
If 2Z > X + Y , then defecting while your playmate defects creates value. I have no
issue thinking of this as a Prisoner's Dilemma; my instinct is that most analyses of the
central case will also apply to this.
By assigning diﬀerent values to the various numbers, what other games can we get?

As far as I can tell, we can classify games according to the ordering of W, X, Y , Z (which
determine individual outcomes) and of 2W, X + Y , 2Z (which determine the social outcomes).
Sometimes we'll want to consider the case when two values are equal, but for simplicity I'm
going to classify them assuming there are no equalities. Naively there would be 4! ⋅3! = 144
 possible games, but
Reversing the order of everything doesn't change the analysis, it just swaps the labels
Krump and Flitz. So we can assume without loss of generality that W > Z. That
eliminates half the combinations.
Obviously 2W > 2Z, so it's just a question of where X + Y  falls in comparison to them.
That eliminates another half.
If W > Z > ∙> ∙ then X + Y < 2Z. That eliminates another four combinations.
If ∙> ∙> W > Z then X + Y > 2W, eliminating another four.
If W > ∙> ∙> Z then 2W > X + Y > 2Z, eliminating four.
If W > ∙> Z > ∙ then 2W > X + Y , eliminating two.
If ∙> W > ∙> Z then X + Y > 2Z, eliminating two.
That brings us down to just 20 combinations, and we've already looked at three of them, so
this seems tractable. In the following, I've grouped games together mostly according to how
interesting I think it is to distinguish them, and I've given them names when I didn't know an
existing name. Both the names and the grouping should be considered tentative.
Cake Eating: W > ∙> ∙> Z (two games)
In this game, you can either Eat Cake or Go Hungry. You like eating cake. You like when your
playmate eats cake. There's enough cake for everyone, and no reason to go hungry. The only
Nash equilibrium is the one where everyone eats cake, and this is the socially optimal result.
Great game! We should play it more often.
(If X > Y , then if you had to choose between yourself and your playmate eating cake, you'd
eat it yourself. If Y > X, then in that situation you'd give it to them. Equalities between W, Z
 and X, Y  signify indiﬀerence to (yourself, your playmate) eating cake in various situations.)
Let's Party: W > Z > ∙> ∙ (two games)
In this game, you can either go to a Party or stay Home. If you both go to a party, great! If
you both stay home, that's cool too. If either of you goes to a party while the other stays
home, you'd both be super bummed about that.
Home/Home is a Nash equilibrium, but it's not optimal either individually or socially.

In the case W = Z, this is a pure coordination game, which doesn't have the beneﬁt of an
obvious choice that you can make without communicating.
(Wikipedia calls this the assurance game on that page, but uses that name for the Stag Hunt
on the page for that, so I'm not using that name.)
Studying For a Test: W > X > Z > Y  (two games)
You can either Study or Bunk Oﬀ. No matter what your playmate does, you're better oﬀ
Studying, and if you Study together you can help each other. If you Bunk Oﬀ, then it's more
fun if your playmate Bunks Oﬀ with you; but better still for you if you just start Studying.
The only Nash equilibrium is Study/Study, which is also socially optimal.
Stag hunt: W > Y > Z > X (two games)
You can either hunt Stag or Hare (sometimes "Rabbit"). If you both hunt Stag, you
successfully catch a stag between you, which is great. If you both hunt Hare, you each catch
a hare, which is ﬁne. You can catch a hare by yourself, but if you hunt Stag and your
playmate hunts Hare, you get nothing.
This also works with Y = Z. If Y > Z then two people hunting Hare get in each other's way.
The Nash equilibria are at Stag/Stag and Hare/Hare, and Stag/Stag is socially optimal.
Hare/Hare might be the worst possible social result, though I think this game is usually
described with 2Z > Y + X.
See: The Schelling Choice is "Rabbit", not "Stag".
The Abundant Commons: X > W > ∙> ∙ (ﬁve
games)
You can Take some resource from the commons, or you can Leave it alone. There's plenty of
resource to be taken, and you'll always be better oﬀ taking it. But if you and your playmate
both play Take, you get in each other's way and reduce eﬃciency (unless X = W).
If 2W > X + Y  then you don't intefere with each other signiﬁcantly; the socially optimal result
is also the Nash equilibrium. But if 2W < X + Y  then the total cost of interfering is more than
the value of resource either of you can take, and some means of coordinating one person to
Take and one to Leave would be socially valuable.
If Y > Z then if (for whatever reason) you Leave the resource, you'd prefer your partner
Takes it. If Z > Y  you'd prefer them to also Leave it.

An interesting case here is X > W > Z > Y  and X + Y > 2W. Take/Leave and Leave/Take are
social optimal, but the Leave player would prefer literally any other outcome.
Take/Take is the only Nash equilibrium.
Farmer's Dilemma: Y > W > X > Z (two games)
In this game, you can Work (pitch in to help build a mutual resource) or Shirk (not do that). If
either of you Works, it provides more than its cost to both of you. Ideally, you want to Shirk
while your playmate Works; but if your playmate Shirks, you'd rather Work than leave the
work undone. The Nash equilibria are at Work/Shirk and Shirk/Work.
If 2W > X + Y  then the socially optimal outcome is Work/Work, and a means to coordinate on
that outcome would be socially useful. If 2W < X + Y , the socially optimal outcome is for one
player to Work while the other Shirks, but with no obvious choice for which one of you it
should be.
Also known as Chicken, Hawk/Dove and Snowdrift.
Anti-coordination: ∙> ∙> W > Z (two games)
In this game, the goal is to play a diﬀerent move than your playmate. If X = Y  then there's
no reason to prefer one move over another, but if they're not equal there'll be some
maneuvering around who gets which reward. If you're not happy with the outcome, then
changing the move you play will harm your playmate more than it harms you. The Nash
equilibria are when you play diﬀerent moves, and these are socially optimal.
Prisoner's Dilemma/Too Many Cooks: 
Y > W > Z > X (three games)
Covered in preamble.
(I'm a little surprised that this is the only case where I've wanted to rename the game
depending on the social preference of the outcomes. That said, the only other games where 
X + Y  isn't forced to be greater or less than 2X are the Farmer's Dilemma and the Abundant
Commons, and those are the ones I'd most expect to want to split in future.)
A graph
I made a graph of these games. I only classiﬁed them according to ordering of W, X, Y , Z (i.e.
I lumped Prisoner's Dilemma with Too Many Cooks), and I drew an edge whenever two games
were the same apart from swapping two adjacent values. It looks like this:

source
The lines are colored according to which pair of values is swapped (red ﬁrst two, blue middle
two, green last two). I'm not sure we learn much from it, but I ﬁnd the symmetry pleasing.
A change of basis?

I don't want to look too deep into this right now, but here's a transformation we could apply.
Instead of thinking about these games in terms of the numbers W, X, Y , Z, we think in terms
of "the value of Player 2 playing Flitz over Krump":
α = X −W, the value to Player 1, if Player 1 plays Krump.
β = Y −W, the value to Player 2, if Player 1 plays Krump.
γ = Z −Y , the value to Player 1, if Player 1 plays Flitz.
δ = Z −X, the value to Player 2, if Player 1 plays Flitz.
These four numbers determine W, X, Y , Z, up to adding a constant value to all of them, which
doesn't change the games. For example, Prisoner's Dilemma and Too Many Cooks both have 
α < 0, β > 0, γ < 0, δ > 0. A Prisoner's Dilemma also has α + β < 0 while Too Many Cooks has 
α + β > 0.
So what happens if we start thinking about these games in terms of α, β, γ, δ instead? Does
this give us useful insights? I don't know.
Of course, for these numbers to point at one of the games studied in this post, we must
have α −β = γ −δ. I think if you relax that constraint, you start looking into games slightly
more general than these. But I haven't thought about it too hard.

Can you get AGI from a Transformer?
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
Introduction
I want to share my thoughts about the calculations that Transformers (such as GPT-3)
do, and the calculations that I think are required for general intelligence, and how well
they line up, and what I think GPT-3 is doing under the hood, and why I think an
arbitrary transformer-based GPT-N might be incapable of doing certain tasks are
seemingly essential for a system to qualify as an AGI.
Epistemic status: Very low conﬁdence, to the point that I almost decided to delete this
without posting it. I think some of my opinions here are very unpopular, and I would
love any feedback or discussion.
Before we get into it, I want to make a couple background claims. The point here is
basically to argue that the question "Can you get general intelligence by suﬃciently
scaling up a Transformer?" is worth asking, and does not have an answer of
"Obviously yes, duh!!!" You can skip this part if you already agree with me on that.
Background Claim 1: There are types of
information processing that cannot be cast in
the form of Deep Neural Net (DNN)-type
calculations (= matrix multiplications, ReLUs,
etc.), except with an exorbitant performance
penalty.
(Update: After discussion in the comments section here , I should have framed this
section diﬀerently: I should have said "For any given speciﬁc learning algorithm /
architecture framework (e.g. "GPT-like transformer architectures"), there
are types of information processing that cannot be performed within that
speciﬁc framework, except with an exorbitant performance penalty". I should
never have mentioned "DNN-type calculations (=matrix multiplications, ReLUs, etc.)",
because that's awfully vague (what exactly does the "etc." mean?), and anyway it's
irrelevant to this post. Thanks gwern.)
By "information processing" I mean anything from sorting algorithms to data
compression, random access memories, hash tables, whatever.
Let's take Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as an example. AlphaZero does MCTS
because DeepMind engineers explicitly programmed it to do MCTS—not because a
generic RNN or other deep learning system spontaneously discovered, during gradient
descent, that MCTS is a good idea.

Now, in principle, DNNs are universal function approximators, and more to the point,
RNNs are Turing complete. So an RNN can emulate any other algorithm, including
MCTS. But that doesn't mean it can emulate it eﬃciently!
Let's say we take a generic (PyTorch default) RNN, and train it such that it is
incentivized to discover and start using MCTS. Assuming that the gradient ﬂows
converge to MCTS (a big "if"!), I believe (low conﬁdence) that its only method for
actually executing the MCTS involves: 
Taking a certain highly parallelized algorithm running on a GPU (matrix
multiplications, ReLUs, etc.)...
...and using it to emulate a Turing-machine-type serial computer...
...and using that to emulate a diﬀerent highly parallelizable algorithm!
This is absurdly ineﬃcient when compared to MCTS written by a DeepMind engineer
and compiled to run directly on bare hardware with appropriate parallelization. Like,
maybe, factor-of-a-million ineﬃcient—this is not the kind of ineﬃciency where you can
just shrug it oﬀ and wait a year or two for Moore's law to care of it.
MCTS is just one example. Again, you can open up your algorithms textbook and ﬁnd
thousands of ways to process information. What fraction of these can be implemented
reasonably well in the form of DNN-type matrix multiplications / ReLUs / etc.? I expect
<<100%. If any such type of information processing is essential for AGI, then we
should expect that we won't get AGI in a pure DNN.
(We could still get it in a DNN-plus-other-stuﬀ, e.g. DNN-plus-MCTS, DNN-plus-random-
access-memory, etc.)
Background Claim 2: We can't just brush
aside Background Claim 1 by appealing to the
"Bitter Lesson"
Rich Sutton's Bitter Lesson says that "general methods that leverage computation"
have tended to outperform methods that "leverage...human knowledge of the
domain". I strongly agree with this. As I've argued—most recently here—I think that
the neocortex (or pallium in birds and lizards) uses a "general method that leverages
computation" to understand the world, act, reason, etc. And I think we could
absolutely get AGI using that method. By contrast—again in agreement with Rich
Sutton—I think it's much less likely that we would get AGI from, say, hand-coded rules
about proper reasoning, knowledge graphs, etc. Although who knows, I guess.
Now, read it carefully: Rich Sutton's claim is that the best way to solve any given
problem will be a "general method that leverages computation". The claim is not the
reverse, i.e., if you have any "general method that leverages computation", it will
solve every problem, if only you leverage enough computation!
A fully-connected feedforward neural net is a "general method that leverages
computation", but it can't do what a GAN or MuZero or Transformer does, no matter
how much computation you leverage. It still has to be an appropriate method, with
appropriate learning algorithm, parametrization, dataset, etc.

So, just like a fully-connected feedforward neural net is not the right "general method"
for NLP, I think it's at least open to question whether the more general paradigm of
matrix-multiplications-and-ReLUs (possibly attached to other simple components like
MCTS, RAM, etc.) is deﬁnitely the right "general method" for general intelligence.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't! It's an open question.
(And by the way, I freely acknowledge that this paradigm can do lots of amazing
things, including things that I probably wouldn't have expected it to be able to do, if I
didn't already know.)
OK, so far, all this is just to plant the general idea that DNNs do a particular type of
information processing, and that there's no guarantee that it's the right type of
information processing for AGI, merely a suggestion from the fact that it is a form of
information processing that can do lots of amazing things that seem to be related to
AGI.
Generative-model-based information
processing: Background and
motivation
Moving on, now I'll switch gears and talk more speciﬁcally about a certain type of
information processing that I think might be critical for AGI, and after that I'll talk
about how that relates to the information processing in DNNs (and more speciﬁcally,
Transformers like GPT-3).
Predicting inputs with generative models
(a.k.a. "analysis by synthesis" or
"probabilistic programming")
I'll introduce the idea of analysis-by-synthesis via an unusually simple example:
Towards the First Adversarially Robust NN Model on MNIST. MNIST is a famous
collection of low-resolution images of handwritten digits, and the task is to recognize
the digit from the image pixels. The traditional deep learning method for solving
MNIST is: You do gradient descent to ﬁnd a ConvNet model whose input is pixel values
and whose output is a probability distribution for which digit it is. In this paper here,
however, they go the other direction: They build a generative model for pictures
representing the digit "0", a diﬀerent generative model for the digit "1", etc. Then,
when presented with a new digit image, they do ten calculations in parallel: How
compatible is this image with the "0" generative model? How compatible is it with the
"1" generative model? ... They then pick the hypothesis that best ﬁts the data.
Suggestively, their classiﬁcation method winds up unusually human-like—it makes
similar mistakes and has similar confusions as humans (assuming the paper is
correct), unlike those funny examples in the adversarial perturbation literature.
As in this example, analysis-by-synthesis is any algorithm that searches
through a collection / space of generative models for a model that best ﬁts
the input data (or better yet, with time-varying inputs, a model that predicts the

input data that will arrive next). I've seen two other analysis-by-synthesis digit-
recognition papers: Josh Tenenbaum & coworkers using classic probabilistic
programming; and Dileep George & coworkers using a brain-inspired approach (and
see also a nice series of blog posts introducing the latter).
The latter captures, I think, an essential aspect of the neocortex, in that there's a
whole society of generative models. Some of these generative models are at a
very low level, and make predictions (with attached conﬁdence levels) that certain
sensory inputs will or won't be active. But more often the generative models make
predictions that other generative models will or won't be active. (These predictions
can all be functions of time, or of other parameters—I'm leaving aside lots of details).
To oversimplify, imagine that if the "bird" generative model is active, it also sends out
a low-conﬁdence prediction that the "is ﬂying" generative model is also active, and
that the "noun" generative model is active, and so on. This leads to not only
hierarchical generative models, but also other forms of compositionality. For example,
there's a "purple jar" generative model that more-or-less just predicts that the
"purple" generative model and the "jar" generative model are active simultaneously.
This works because the "purple" and "jar" models make (by-and-large) compatible
predictions—they agree with each other on some predictions, and in other cases
they're making predictions about diﬀerent things. By contrast, there is no "stationary
dancing" composite model—those two models make contradictory predictions. When
two mutually-incompatible generative models are active simultaneously, they kinda
ﬁght each other for dominance. The algorithm underlying that "ﬁght" is at least
vaguely analogous to message-passing in a probabilistic graphical model.
See more of my thoughts at Gary Marcus vs Cortical Uniformity and Predictive coding
= RL + SL + Bayes + MPC.
What's so great about generative-model-
based processing?
Well, you might say, OK, analysis-by-synthesis is an interesting approach. But is it
essential for AGI? Or is it just one of many ways to do things? I think it's at least
plausibly essential. Consider some of its features...
Feature 1: Better and better results with a longer search
Example: You look at a picture of a camouﬂaged animal, hidden so well that you can't
ﬁnd it at ﬁrst. But after staring for a minute, it snaps into place, and you recognize it.
Example: Your code has a syntax error on line 12. You stare at the line for a few
seconds, and then ﬁnally see the problem.
Since we're doing a search over a space of generative models, if we don't ﬁnd a good
match immediately, we can notice our confusion and keep searching. The space of
generative models is astronomically large; you can always search more, given more
time.
Feature 2: Generative models are simpler & easier to learn than
discriminative models
Example: You are asked to prove a simple theorem for homework. You spend a few
minutes thinking through diﬀerent possible lines of attack, and eventually see an
approach that will work.

Example: You are asked to invent a microscope with higher resolution and speed than
what exists today. You think through a wide array of many diﬀerent possible
conﬁgurations of lenses, lasers, ﬁlters, polarizers, galvos, sample-holders, etc.
Eventually you come up with a conﬁguration that meets all requirements.
In both these cases, the forward / generative direction has a (relatively) simple
structure: If you diﬀerentiate both sides, what happens? By contrast, the reverse /
discriminative direction is almost arbitrarily complex: At the end, you proved the
theorem; what was the ﬁrst step? A model that could immediately answer the endless
variety of such reverse-direction question seems like it would be hopelessly complex
to learn!
In fact, probably the only way that the reverse model could be learned is by ﬁrst
developing a good generative model, running it through in lots of conﬁgurations, and
training a reverse model on that. And something like that is indeed entirely possible!
In humans, there's a kind of memorization / chunking that allows the system to
"cache" the results of runs through the generative models, so that the corresponding
reverse-lookup can be very fast in the future. Actually, this is not so far from how
AlphaZero works too—in that case, the MCTS self-play functions as the generative
model. 
Feature 3: A generative-model-based approach is more sample-eﬃcient and
out-of-distribution-generalizable
This is related to Feature 2. Since generative models are simpler (less information
content) than reverse / discriminative models, they can be learned more quickly.
Empirically, I think this is borne out by those three digit-recognition papers I cited
above, and by the fact that humans can do zero-shot transfer learning in all kinds of
situations. (Of course, humans need to spend years cultivating a healthy and diverse
society of generative models; the sample-eﬃciency I'm talking about is after that.)
Another way to think about it: things in the world are, in reality, generated by highly
structured hierarchical-and-compositional-generative-model-type processes. If we
want a good inductive bias, then we need to structure our analysis in a parallel way:
we need to go looking for those kinds of generative models until we ﬁnd ones that
explain the data. Better inductive bias means better out-of-distribution generalization
and fewer samples required.
Example: You read about a new concept you hadn't heard of—Quantum Capacitance.
You ﬁnd it confusing at ﬁrst, but after reading a couple descriptions and thinking about
it, you ﬁnd a good mental model of it—a certain way to visualize it, to relate it to other
known concepts, etc. Having internalized that concept, you can then go use it and
build on it in the future.
In this example, you built a good generative model of Quantum Capacitance despite
little or even no concrete examples of it. How? For one thing, you're not building it
from scratch, you're snapping together a few pieces of generative models you've
already learned, and your textbook helps you ﬁgure out which ones, by describing the
concept using analogies, ﬁgurative spatial language, etc. For another thing, you are
trying to slot this concept into a dense web of previously-established physics-related
generative models, each of which will protest loudly if they see something that
contradicts them. In other words, there are only so many ways to create this concept
in a way that doesn't contradict the things about physics you have already come to
believe. Third, you can test any number of proposed generative model against the

same known examples—sorta vaguely like oﬀ-policy replay learning or something. So
anyway, with all these ingredients, it's a highly constrained problem, and so you can
can ﬁnd the right model with few if any concrete examples.
Feature 4: Foresight, counterfactuals, deliberation, etc.
A society of generative models is a powerful thing...
It allows foresighted plans towards goals—in fact, this capability involves almost
the same information-processing steps as analysis-by-synthesis understanding
of sensory inputs (see my post here, or Planning by Probabilistic Inference, or
Logical Inductor Decision Theory, etc.)
It enables counterfactual reasoning—see my brief discussion here.
It enables system-2-type deliberation—e.g. you can learn a Generative Model X
that invokes a Generative Model Y and then invokes either Generative Model Z
or Z' depending on some feature of Y. Then Z or Z' can invoke yet diﬀerent
generative models, and so on. That kind of process enables us to create an ad
hoc crappy serial computer ... and we call that "deliberation"! See also Kaj's
post.
I could go on, but you get the idea.
So, at the end of the day, is the generative-
model-based approach essential for
superintelligent AGI?
I mean, it kind of feels that way to me, but maybe I'm anthropomorphizing.
Back to Transformers and GPT-N
OK, you've read all this way, now how does this relate to GPT-3? Will GPT-N be an AGI
or not??
Now, when the brain does its probabilistic generative model inference thing, it does it
by a complicated, decentralized process. There's a feedforward pass that activates
some of the most promising generative models. Then the models do some message-
passing back and forth. Contradictory models ﬁght it out. New models get awakened.
Redundant models go away, etc. Multi-step models, extended through time, walk
through their steps.
So here's my hypothesis: this whole complicated decentralized
asynchronous probabilistic-generative-model-inference process is more-or-
less exactly what the GPT-3 Transformer learns to approximate.
As a special case: I feel pretty comfortable imagining that a single trained Transformer
layer can approximate a single step of message-passing in a probabilistic graphical
model inference algorithm.
Now, I haven't thought this through in any amount of detail, but so far this hypothesis
seems at least plausible to me. For example, the Transformer has residual connections
that allow later iterations to create small increments in the activations, which is what

often happens with later stages of message-passing. It has a self-attention mechanism
that seems well-suited to representing the sparsely-connected structure of a
probabilistic graphical model. It has the positional information that it needs to ﬁgure
out how far along the various multi-step generative models have progressed. GPT-2
has 12 layers and GPT-3 has 96, enough for quite a lot of sequential processing, which
is important to capture this asynchronous process as it unfolds in time.
I like this hypothesis a lot because it's consistent with my strong belief that GPT-3 has
captured human-like concepts and can search through them and manipulate
them and combine them in a very human-like way.
So, does that mean GPT-3 is a human-like intelligence? No!! There's a big
diﬀerence!
If you have an algorithm designed from the ground up to build and search
through generative models and do probabilistic generative model inference, it
will do that, and always exactly that, and only exactly that.
If you have a Transformer, it can imitate that kind of probabilistic generative
model inference, but will do so only within the range covered by its training
data, e.g. a restricted time-window etc. And that same Transformer architecture
can also do loads of other very diﬀerent types of calculations too, that have
nothing to do with probabilistic generative model inference—which means that
the Transformer will have diﬀerent inductive biases, and worse sample eﬃciency.
Let me oﬀer a more speciﬁc list of my hypothesized fundamental deﬁciencies in
Transformers as AGIs.
First, for the reason mentioned above, I think the sample eﬃciency is bound to be
dramatically worse for training a Transformer versus training a real generative-model-
centric system. And this makes it diﬃcult or impossible for it to learn or create
concepts that humans are not already using.
For example, I am conﬁdent that GPT-N, after reading tons of text where people use
some random concept (Quantum Capacitance, say), can gradient-descent its way to
properly using that concept, and to properly integrating it into its (implicit) world-
model. But if GPT-N had never heard of Quantum Capacitance, and saw one good
explanation in its training data, I'm pretty skeptical that it would be able to use the
concept properly. And I'm even more skeptical that it could invent that concept from
scratch.
To clarify, I'm talking here about sample-ineﬃciency in modifying the weights to form
a more sophisticated permanent understanding of the world. By contrast, I think there
is little doubt that it has the ability to alter its activations in a quick and ﬂexible and
sample-eﬃcient way in response to thought-provoking input text. But that only takes
you so far! That cannot take you more than a couple steps of inferential distance away
from the span of concepts frequently used by humans in the training data. 
Second, the ﬁnite number of Transformer layers puts a ceiling on the quality
of the generative-model-search process, the time spent deliberating, etc. As
I mentioned above, humans can stretch their capabilities by thinking a little bit longer
and harder. However, if you have a Transformer that more-or-less simulates the ﬁrst
100 (or whatever) milliseconds of the neocortex's generative-model-search process,
then that's all you can ever get.

Third, because the Transformer is a kind of information processing imitating a
diﬀerent kind of information processing, I generally expect edge cases where the
imitation breaks down, leading to weird inductive biases, crazy out-of-
distribution behavior, etc. I'm not too sure about this one though.
Maybe there are other things too.
Then of course there are also the obvious things like GPT-3 being disembodied, not
having a reward signal, not having visual or spatial input channels, etc. These are all
plausibly very important, but I don't think want to emphasize them too much, because
I don't think they're fundamental architectural limitations, I think they're more likely
just things that OpenAI hasn't gotten around to doing yet.
Conclusion
These three deﬁciencies I'm hypothesizing seem like pretty serious roadblocks to AGI
—especially the one where I claim that it can't form new concepts and add them
permanently to its world-model.
That said, it's entirely possible that these deﬁciencies don't matter, or can be worked
around. (Or that I'm just wrong.)
But for the moment, I continue to consider it very possible that
Transformers speciﬁcally, and DNN-type processing more generally (matrix
multiplications, ReLUs, etc.), for all their amazing powers, will eventually be
surpassed in AGI-type capabilities by a diﬀerent kind of information
processing, more like probabilistic programming and message-passing, and
also more like the neocortex (but, just like DNNs, still based on relatively simple,
general principles, and still requiring an awful lot of compute).
I recognize that this kind of probabilistic programming stuﬀ is not as "hot" as DNNs
right now, but it's not neglected either; it's a pretty active area of CS research, moving
forward each year.
But I dunno. As I mentioned, I'm not conﬁdent about any of this, and I am very
interested in discussion and feedback here. :-)

The Goldbach conjecture is probably
correct; so was Fermat's last theorem
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
EDIT: Added a section on Euler's conjecture.
The Goldbach conjecture is likely
The Goldbach conjecture is that "every even integer above two is the sum of two
primes". For example, 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 5 + 3, and so on.
Though this is a mathematically precise statement, we can talk about the "probability"
of it begin correct. How so?
Well, by the prime number theorem, the probability of a random number less than N
being prime, is 1/ log(N). So if we sum up all the primes less than N, we get 
(N/ log(N))2 diﬀerent sums; these sums will be less than 2N.
So, is N itself is one of these sums? Well, the "probability" that it's not the total of any
given sum is 1 −
; therefore the probability of it being the total of none of the sums
is:
(1 −
)
(N/ log(N))2
= ((1 −
)
2N
)
N/(2 log(N)2)
≈(1/e)N/(2 log(N)2).
So the probability of N being the total of such a sum is roughly:
1 −e−N/(2 log(N)2).
Therefore, the probability of all numbers N being the total of such a sum is roughly:
p2 =
∞
∏
N=2
1 −e−N/(2 log(N)2).
1
2N
1
2N
1
2N

Now, the inﬁnite product p2 converges to a non-zero number if and only if the sum 
∑
∞
N=1 e−N/(2 log(N)2) converges to a ﬁnite number. That series can be seen to be
convergent (for example, by noting that e−N/(2 log(N)2) < 1/N 2 for large enough N and
using the comparison test).
If use computers to get an estimate of p2, we get a pretty low probability. However,
most of that improbability mass is on the low numbers, and the Goldbach conjecture
has been tested up to 4 × 1018. So, if we assume it's valid up to 1000, we numerically
get:
p1000 =
∞
∏
N=1000
1 −e−N/(2 log(N)2) ≈0.9961.
So the Goldbach conjecture is pretty likely, and, the more examples we discover
where it holds, the more likely it is to hold all the way to inﬁnity.
"Probabilities" of logical facts
The above reasoning seems dubious. The primes are not deﬁned by random sampling
among the natural numbers; quite to the contrary, they come from a mathematical
rule of extreme precision. So what do these probabilities mean?
Let X be an inﬁnite set of numbers, selected from the natural numbers in a way that
looks like the prime number theorem (eg the n-th number is approximately n log(n)).
Then what we've shown is that, if such an X obeys the "X-Goldbach conjecture" up to 
1000, then we'd expect it to go all the way to inﬁnity.
Thus the Goldbach conjecture can be restated as "in terms of sums of two elements,
the prime numbers behave like a typical sequence selected in a prime-number-
theorem way".
So the Goldbach conjecture is not saying that there is something special about the
primes; in fact, it's saying the opposite, that the primes are typical of similar
sequences, that nothing in the speciﬁc ways that the primes are selected has an
impact on the sum of two primes. So the Goldbach conjecture is essentially saying
"there is no obstruction to the primes being typical in this way".
One obstruction

Did you notice that, so far, at no point did I require N to be an even number? But all
the primes except for 2 are odd. So the distribution of sums of primes is very (very!)
heavily skewed towards even numbers; most odd numbers will not appear at all. So,
that is one clear obstruction to the possible values of the sum, coming from the way
the primes are constructed. The Goldbach conjecture is therefore saying that there are
no additional obstructions beyond this one condition on parity.
In fact, the Goldbach conjecture has changed; 1 used to be seen as a prime number,
and the original conjecture included 2 = 1 + 1 as another example Then 1 was
removed from the list of prime numbers, and it turned out, as far as we can tell, that 2
was the only even number we lost from the list of sums.
If we removed 2 from the list of primes, we'd only lose 4 = 2 + 2 as a sum. Similarly, if
we strike out the ﬁrst m primes, we expect - on probabilistic grounds - that "all
numbers greater than a given n are the sums of two primes (ﬁrst m primes not
included)". If that were to fail, then there's a really interesting obstruction out there.
Fermat's last theorem was likely (for 
n > 3)
We can show, similarly, that Fermat's last theorem was very likely on probabilistic
grounds. The theorem states that, for n > 2, there do not exist natural numbers 
x, y, z > 0 such that xn + yn = zn.
Fix z and n > 3. Counting 1 and z, there are z natural numbers less than or equal to z.
Therefore there are z2 possible xn + yn, all less than 2zn. So the probability that any
two of these n-th powers sum to zn is z2/(2zn) = 1/(2zn−2).
So the probability that there are no z's such that zn = xn + yn, is
p2,n =
∞
∏
z=2
1 −1/(2zn−2).

The sum ∑
∞
z=2(1/2) ⋅1/(zn−2) converges. Moreover, we can also sum over n: 
∑
∞
z=2,n=4(1/2) ⋅1/(zn−2) = ∑
∞
z=2(1/2) ⋅z−2
. This also converges. So the probability of
Fermat's last theorem was non-zero, at least for n > 3; add on the fact that the
theorem was proved for many n and checked for many x, y, and z, means that, even
before it was proved, it was very probable it was correct.
So Andrew Wiles's genius was in showing there were no unexpected obstructions for
the "likely" outcome to be true. That's why the proof is so hard: he was trying to prove
something very "likely", and show an absence of structure, rather than a presence,
without knowing what that structure could be.
Euler's conjecture was unlikely
Euler's conjecture was that you needed to sum at least n powers of n to get another
power of n; Fermat's last theorem establishes this for n = 3, and Euler theorised that
this extended.
Euler's theorem is in fact false; for n = 4 we have three fourth powers that sum to
another fourth power as:
958004 + 2175194 + 4145604 = 4224814.
There are counterexamples known for n = 5 as well, so the conjecture is false, and not
just for one value of n.
More interesting from our perspective, we expect it to be false on probabilistic
grounds. Recall that the argument about Fermat's last theorem does not work for 
n = 3; it fails because the crucial sum is of the type 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ..., which
diverges.
Similarly, if we estimate the probability of Euler's conjecture, we get terms like the
following (for some constants Cn):
p2,n =
∞
∏
z=2
1 −Cn/(zn−(n−1)) = p2,n =
∞
∏
z=2
1 −Cn/z.
This goes to zero for the same reason as the n = 3 case.
1
1−1/z

So, on probabilistic grounds, we expect Fermat's last theorem to be true for n ≥4, and
we expect Euler's conjecture to be false.
The only unexpected result here is that Fermat's last theorem and Euler's conjecture
are true for n = 3. So something about the structure of the problem for n = 3 is
moving the result away from the probabilistic outcome.
The "Stuart conjecture"
Based on what I wrote about Euler's conjecture, I'll hazard a conjecture myself, which I
believe to be true on probabilistic grounds. Namely that if there are k integers, whose 
n-th powers sum non-trivially to another n-th power, then k is greater than or equal to 
n/2.
Fermat's last theorem shows this is true for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Solving Math Problems by Relay
From September to November 2018 we ran an experiment where people did programming in
relay. Each player spent ten minutes on a programming problem before passing on their
code to a new player who had not seen any of the previous work. We found that people were
able to solve some problems using the relay approach, but that the approach was less
eﬃcient than having a single person work on their own. This project explored hypotheses
around Factored Cognition, testing whether people can solve problems by decomposing
them into self-contained sub-problems.
Since this was an "explorative" experiment it wasn't a priority to write up, though we are
excited to have gotten around to it now and hope this both informs and inspires other
experiments.
Introduction
Factored cognition research investigates ways of accomplishing complex tasks by
decomposing them into smaller sub-tasks. Task decomposition is not a new idea: it's widely
recognized as fundamental to modern economies. People have worked out ways to
decompose complex tasks (e.g. create an electric car) into smaller sub-tasks (create an
engine and battery, design steering controls, test the car for safety) which in turn are broken
down into yet smaller tasks, and so on. The smallest sub-tasks are carried out by individual
humans, who may have a limited understanding of how their work relates to the original
task.
The focus is on the decomposition of cognitive tasks, where the goal is to provide
information or to answer a question. Cognitive tasks include solving a mathematics problem,
analyzing a dataset, or summarizing a story.
Factored Cognition research explores whether complex cognitive tasks can be solved
through recursive decomposition into self-contained, interpretable sub-tasks that can be
solved more easily than the originally task.[1]
Sub-tasks are "self-contained" if they are solvable without knowledge about the broader
context of the task. If the task is a hard physics problem, then self-contained sub-tasks would
be solvable for someone who hasn't seen the physics problem (and need not know the task
is about physics). This diﬀers from most real-world examples of collaborative problem
solving, where everyone in the team knows what task is being solved.
Testing the Factored Cognition Hypothesis involves the following steps:
Finding cognitive tasks that seem costly or diﬃcult to solve directly (e.g. because
normally one person would spend days or weeks on the same problem rather than 10
minutes).
Generating a high-level strategy that would plausibly decompose the task.
Testing whether the strategy from (2) works by having a group of people solve (1)
under controlled conditions.
For some ideas on high-level strategies for a range of problems, see Ought's Factored
Cognition slides and the paper Supervising strong learners by amplifying weak experts
(Appendix B).
In the Relay Game participants worked on a task sequentially, with each person having ten
minutes to help solve the problem before handing oﬀ to the next person (see Figure 1). This
is similar to real-world situations where one person quits a project and someone else takes

over. However, the big diﬀerence comes from the ten-minute time limit. If the task is
complex, it might take ten minutes just to read and understand the task description. This
means that most players in the relay won't have time to both understand the task and make
a useful contribution. Instead players must solve sub-tasks that previous people have
constructed.
Figure 1: In the Relay Approach (left), each person works on a programming problem for a
ﬁxed number of minutes before passing over their notes and code to the next person.
Eventually someone in the chain completes the problem. This contrasts with the usual
approach (right), where a single person works for an extended period. Note: Our
experiments had a time limit of 10 minutes per person (vs. 1 minute in the illustration)
We tested the Relay Game on programming problems from Project Euler. Here is a simple
example problem:
How many diﬀerent ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive
integers?
Solving these problems requires both mathematical insight and a working implementation in
code. The problems would take 20-90 minutes for one of our players working alone and we
expected the relay approach to be substantially slower.

Experiment Design
Players worked on a shared Google doc (for notes) and code editor (see Figure 2). The ﬁrst
player receives only the Project Euler problem and begins making notes in the doc and
writing code. After ten minutes, the second player takes over the doc and code editor. The
Relay ends when a player computes the correct answer to the problem, which can be
automatically veriﬁed at Project Euler.
Figure 2
We had 103 programmers volunteer to play Relay. They started 40 questions in total but only
25 had relay chains of more than 5 people. The total amount of work was 48 hours and only
four questions were successfully solved. See Table 1 for a breakdown of a subset of the 40
questions. (Note: Most of the 103 players only worked on a few problems. Since much of the
work was done by a smaller number of players, they were spread thinly over the 40
problems -- as each player spends just 10 minutes on a problem.)
Table of Relay Game Problems (10 of 40)

Table 1: The total time spent on each problem for Relay. Note that most problems were not
solved by Relay and so would take longer to actually solve. (So solo vs. Relay cannot be
directly compared).
Can we conclude from Table 1 that Relay is much less eﬃcient than the usual way of working
on problems? Not really. It could be that Relay players would get better with experience by
developing strategies for decomposing problems and coordinating work. So the main lesson

from this experiment is that Relay with inexperienced players is probably less eﬃcient at
Project Euler problems. (We say "probably" because we did not conduct a rigorous
comparison of Relay vs the usual way of solving problems).
Clickthrough Examples
We are interested in general failure modes for Factored Cognition with humans and in
strategies for avoiding them. Our Relay experiment is a ﬁrst step in this direction. We exhibit
concrete examples from our Relay experiment that are suggestive of pitfalls and good
practices for Factored Cognition.
Here are three "click-throughs", which show how ideas and code evolved for particular
Project Euler problems.
Prize Strings
In these three attempts on Prize Strings the players quickly build on players previous work
and get the correct answer. Clickthrough
Empty Chairs
Empty Chairs was not solved but signiﬁcant progress was made (with seven people
contributing). The clickthrough demonstrates iterative improvements to a math heavy
solution. Clickthrough

A Scoop of Blancmange
There were 13 unique attempts on A Scoop of Blancmange. While technically unsolved, the
answer was oﬀ by only 1e-8. Only attempts that changed the state of the problem are
shown. Clickthrough

Adding Meta-data to Notes
Relay players worked on the mathematical part of the Project Euler problems by writing
notes in a Google Doc. A tactic that emerged organically in early rounds was to label
contributions with meta-data with speciﬁc formatting (ex.using square brackets,
strikethroughs). The meta-data was intended to provide a quick way for future players to
decide which parts of the Google doc to read and which to ignore.
Summarizing Next Actions
For several problems the Google doc became messy and probably made it diﬃcult for new
players to orient themselves. An example is the problem Prime Triples Geometric Sequence,
shown here mid-round, where some of the subsequent rounds were spent cleaning up these
notes and formulating clear next steps.

Costly Bugs

The problem with the longest Relay chain was Pandigital Step Numbers with a chain of 41
players. While substantial progress was made on the problem, there was a one-line bug in
the code implementation that persisted to the last player in the chain. Given the size and
complexity of the problem, it was diﬃcult for players to locate the bug in only ten minutes.
Figure 3. Code window for Pandigital Step Numbers problem. The highlighted line contains
the bug that probably contributed to the failure of a 41-person Relay to solve the problem.
The code incorrectly sets the ﬁrst digit of the number in the bitmask as "False".
Discussion
How does Relay relate to other research on Factored Cognition with humans? The Relay
experiment had two key features:
We used existing collaboration tools (Google docs and web-based interpreter) rather
than specialized tools for Factored Cognition.
Participants worked in sequence, building on the work of all previous participants.

In 2019 Ought ran experiments with specialized software called Mosaic. Mosaic facilitates
tree-structured decompositions of tasks. The overall task is divided into sub-tasks which can
be solved independently of each other, and users only see a sub-task (i.e. node) and not the
rest of the tree. If this kind of decomposition turns out to be important in Factored Cognition,
then the Relay setup will be less relevant.
The Relay experiment was exploratory and we decided not to continue working on it for now.
Nevertheless we would be interested to hear about related work or to collaborate on
research related to Relay.

Crowdsourcing:
The idea of Factored Cognition is superﬁcially similar to crowdsourcing. Two important
diﬀerences are:
1. In crowdsourcing on Mechanical Turk, the task decomposition is usually ﬁxed ahead of
time and does not have to be done by the crowd.
2. In crowdsourcing for Wikipedia (and other collaborative projects), contributors can
spend much more than ten minutes building expertise in a particular task (Wikipedians
who edit a page might spend years building expertise on the topic).
For more discussion of diﬀerences between Factored Cognition and crowdsourcing and how
they relate to AI alignment, see Ought's Factored Cognition slides and William Saunders'
blogpost on the subject. Despite these diﬀerences, crowdsourcing is useful source of
evidence and insights for Relay and Factored Cognition. See Reinventing Discovery (Michael
Nielsen) for an overview for crowdsourcing for science. Three crowdsourced projects
especially relevant to Relay are:
The Polymath Project was an example of leveraging internet scale collaboration to
solve research problems in mathematics. Starting in 2009, Timothy Gowers posted a
challenging problem to his blog and asked other mathematicians and collaborators to
help push it forward to a solution. This was similar to the type of distributed problem
solving we aimed for with the Relay Game, with the major diﬀerence being in the Relay
game there is a ten minute time limit, so a player can't keep working on a problem.
The MathWorks Competition is a mathematics modeling competition for high school
students. When a student submits an answer to a problem, the code for that solution is
immediately made publicly available. The fastest solutions are then often improved
upon by other students, and resubmitted.
Microtask Programming is a project aiming to apply crowdsourcing techniques to
software development. The project provides a development environment where
software engineers can collaborate to complete small self-contained microtasks that
are automatically generated by the system.

Transmission of information under constraints:
There is also academic research on problem solving under constraints somewhat similar to
Relay.
Causal understanding is not necessary for the improvement of culturally evolving
technology demonstrates how improvements to tool using strategies can evolve
incrementally across "generations" of people, without any one individual understanding
the full underlying causal model.
Cumulative Improvements in Iterated Problem Solving. Similar to the relay chain
model, with solutions to puzzles passed on to later generations to see how they can
build on those solutions.

What counts as defection?

Thanks to Michael Dennis for proposing the formal deﬁnition; to Andrew Critch for pointing

There's a good chance I'd like to publish this at some point as part of a larger work. However,
I wanted to make the work available now, in case that doesn't happen soon.

People talk about 'defection' in social dilemma games, from the prisoner's dilemma to stag
hunt to chicken. In the tragedy of the commons, we talk about defection. The concept has
become a regular part of LessWrong discourse. 
Informal deﬁnition. A player defects when they increase their personal payoﬀ at the
expense of the group.
This informal deﬁnition is no secret, being echoed from the ancient Formal Models of
Dilemmas in Social Decision-Making to the recent Classifying games like the Prisoner's
Dilemma: 
you can model the "defect" action as "take some value for yourself, but destroy value in
the process". 
Given that the prisoner's dilemma is the bread and butter of game theory and of many parts
of economics, evolutionary biology, and psychology, you might think that someone had
already formalized this. However, to my knowledge, no one has.
Formalism

Consider a ﬁnite n-player normal-form game, with player i having pure action set Ai and
payoﬀ function Pi : A1 × ... × An →R. Each player i chooses a strategy si ∈Δ(Ai) (a distribution
over Ai). Together, the strategies form a strategy proﬁle s := (s1, ... , sn). 
s−i := (s1, ... , si−1, si+1, ... , sn) is the strategy proﬁle, excluding player i's strategy. A payoﬀ
proﬁle contains the payoﬀs for all players under a given strategy proﬁle.
A utility weighting (αj)j=1,...,n is a set of n non-negative weights (as in Harsanyi's utilitarian
theorem). You can consider the weights as quantifying each player's contribution; they might
represent a percieved social agreement or be the explicit result of a bargaining process. 
When all αj are equal, we'll call that an equal weighting. However, if there are "utility
monsters", we can downweight them accordingly. 
We're implicitly assuming that payoﬀs are comparable across players. We want to
investigate: given a utility weighting, which actions are defections? 
Deﬁnition. Player i's action a ∈Ai is a defection against strategy proﬁle s and weighting 
(αj)j=1,...,n  if 
1. Personal gain:  P i ( a , s − i ) > P i ( s i , s − i )
2. Social loss: ∑j αjPj(a, s−i) < ∑j αjPj(si, s−i)
If such an action exists for some player i, strategy proﬁle s, and weighting, then we say that
there is an opportunity for defection in the game.
Remark. For an equal weighting, condition (2) is equivalent to demanding that the action not
be a Kaldor-Hicks improvement. 
Payoﬀ proﬁles in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Red arrows represent defections against pure
strategy proﬁles; player 1 defects vertically, while player 2 defects horizontally. For exam
player 2 defects with (C1, C2) →(C1, D2) because they gain (4 > 3) but the weighted sum
loses out (4 < 6).
Our deﬁnition seems to make reasonable intuitive sense. In the tragedy of the commons,
each player rationally increases their utility, while imposing negative externalities on the
other players and decreasing total utility. A spy might leak classiﬁed information, beneﬁting
themselves and Russia but defecting against America. 

Deﬁnition. Cooperation takes place when a strategy proﬁle is maintained despite the
opportunity for defection.
Theorem 1. In constant-sum games, there is no opportunity for defection against equal
weightings.
Theorem 2. In common-payoﬀ games (where all players share the same payoﬀ function),
there is no opportunity for defection.
Edit: In private communication, Joel Leibo points out that these two theorems formalize the
intuition between the proverb "all's fair in love and war": you can't defect in fully competitive
or fully cooperative situations.
Proposition 3. There is no opportunity for defection against Nash equilibria.
An action a ∈Ai is a Pareto improvement over strategy proﬁle s if, for all players j,
Pj(a, s−i) ≥Pj(si, s−i).
Proposition 4. Pareto improvements are never defections. 
Game Theorems
We can prove that formal defection exists in the trifecta of famous games. Feel free to skip
proofs if you aren't interested.
In (a), variables stand for Temptation, Reward, Punishment, and Sucker. A 2 × 2
 symmetric game is a Prisoner's Dilemma when T > R > P > S. Unsurprisingly,
formal defection is everywhere in this game.
Theorem 5. In 2 × 2 symmetric games, if the Prisoner's Dilemma inequality is satisﬁed,
defection can exist against equal weightings.
Proof. Suppose the Prisoner's Dilemma inequality holds. Further suppose that R >
(T + S).
Then 2R > T + S. Then since T > R but T + S < 2R, both players defect from (C1, C2) with Di.
Suppose instead that R ≤
(T + S). Then T + S ≥2R > 2P, so T + S > 2P. But P > S, so
player 1 defects from (C1, D2) with action D1, and player 2 defects from (D1, C2) with action 
D2. QED.

A 2 × 2 symmetric game is a Stag Hunt when R > T ≥P > S. In Stag Hunts, due
to uncertainty about whether the other player will hunt stag, players defect and
fail to coordinate on the unique Pareto optimum (Stag1,  Stag2). In (b), player 2
will defect (play Hare2) when P(Stag1) <
. In Stag Hunts, formal defection can
always occur against mixed strategy proﬁles, which lines up with defection in this
game being due to uncertainty.
Theorem 6. In 2 × 2 symmetric games, if the Stag Hunt inequality is satisﬁed, defection can
exist against equal weightings.
Proof. Suppose that the Stag Hunt inequality is satisﬁed. Let p be the probability that player
1 plays Stag1. We now show that player 2 can always defect against strategy proﬁle 
(p, Stag2) for some value of p.
For defection's ﬁrst condition, we determine when P2(p, Stag2) < P2(p, Hare2):
p R + ( 1 − p ) S  < p T + ( 1 − p ) P 
p  < 
  . 
This denominator is positive (R > T and P > S), as is the numerator. The fraction clearly falls
in the open interval (0, 1).
For defection's second condition, we determine when
P 1 ( p , Stag 2 ) + P 2 ( p , Stag 2 )  > P 1 ( p , Hare 2 ) + P 2 ( p , Hare 2 ) 
2 p R + ( 1 − p ) ( T + S )  > p ( S + T ) + ( 1 − p ) 2 P 
p  > 
  
  . 
Combining the two conditions, we have

P − S
( R − T ) + ( P − S )
12
( P − S ) + ( P − T )
( R − T ) + ( P − S )

  
  1 > 
  > p > 
  
  . 
Since P −T ≤0, this holds for some nonempty subinterval of [0, 1). QED.
A 2 × 2 symmetric game is Chicken when T > R ≥S > P. In (b), defection only
occurs when 
< P(Turn1) <
: when player 1 is very likely to turn, player 2 is
willing to trade a bit of total payoﬀ for personal payoﬀ.
Theorem 7. In 2 × 2 symmetric games, if the Chicken inequality is satisﬁed, defection can
exist against equal weightings.
Proof. Assume that the Chicken inequality is satisﬁed. This proof proceeds similarly as in
theorem 6. Let p be the probability that player 1's strategy places on Turn1.
For defection's ﬁrst condition, we determine when P2(p, Turn2) < P2(p, Ahead2):
p R + ( 1 − p ) S  < p T + ( 1 − p ) P 
p  > 
  
1 ≥ p  > 
  > 0. 
The inequality ﬂips in the ﬁrst equation because of the division by (R −T) + (P −S), which is
negative (T > R and S > P). S > P, so p > 0; this reﬂects the fact that (Ahead1, Turn2) is a
Nash equilibrium, against which defection is impossible (proposition 3).
For defection's second condition, we determine when
P − S
( R − T ) + ( P − S )
12
( P − S ) + ( P − T )
( R − T ) + ( P − S )
10

P − S
( R − T ) + ( P − S )
S − P
( T − R ) + ( S − P )

P 1 ( p , Turn 2 ) + P 2 ( p , Turn 2 )  > P 1 ( p , Ahead 2 ) + P 2 ( p , Ahead 2 ) 
2 p R + ( 1 − p ) ( T + S )  > p ( S + T ) + ( 1 − p ) 2 P 
p  < 
  
  
p  < 
  
  . 
The inequality again ﬂips because (R −T) + (P −S) is negative. When R ≤
(T + S), we have 
p < 1, in which case defection does not exist against a pure strategy proﬁle.
Combining the two conditions, we have
     
  
  > p > 
  > 0.
Because T > S,
  
  > 
  .
QED.
Discussion
This bit of basic theory will hopefully allow for things like principled classiﬁcation of policies:
"has an agent learned a 'non-cooperative' policy in a multi-agent setting?". For example, the
empirical game-theoretic analyses (EGTA) of Leibo et al.'s Multi-agent Reinforcement
Learning in Sequential Social Dilemmas say that apple-harvesting agents are defecting when
they zap each other with beams. Instead of using a qualitative metric, you could choose a
desired non-zapping strategy proﬁle, and then use EGTA to classify formal defections from
that. This approach would still have a free parameter, but it seems better.
I had vague pre-theoretic intuitions about 'defection', and now I feel more capable of
reasoning about what is and isn't a defection. In particular, I'd been confused by the
diﬀerence between power-seeking and defection, and now I'm not.

How good is humanity at
coordination?
When EAs look at the history of nuclear weapons, their reactions tend to fall into two
camps.
The ﬁrst camp (which I am inclined towards) is "Man, what a total mess. There were so
many near misses, and people involved did such clearly terrible and risky things like
setting up the dead hand system and whatever else. I guess that humans probably
can't be trusted to handle extremely dangerous technology."
The other camp says "No nuclear weapons have been used or detonated accidentally
since 1945. This is the optimal outcome, so I guess this is evidence that humanity is
good at handling dangerous technology."
This mostly comes up because people from the other camp tend to give numbers for
the probability of AI x-risk that are 1-10%, and people from my camp tend to give
numbers that are like 40%-80%. I think both camps are roughly equally represented
among people who work on x-risk prevention, though the optimists have recently
been doing a much more thorough job of arguing for their AI x-risk probabilities than
the pessimists have.
When I talk to people from the other camp, I often have a conversation that goes like
this:
Me: Okay, but what about all these crazy stories from The Doomsday Machine about
extreme recklessness and risk?
Them: I don't trust stories. It's really hard to know what the actual situation was. The
Doomsday Machine is just one book written by an activist who probably isn't that
reliable (eg see his massively exaggerated statements about how dangerous nuclear
winter is). There will always be people telling you that something was a disaster. I
prefer to look at unambiguous and unbiased evidence. In this particular case, the
unbiased, unambiguous questions that we could have bet on in 1945 are things like
"How many nuclear weapons will be ﬁred in anger in the next ﬁfty years? How many
people will die from nuclear weapons? How many buildings will be destroyed?" And
the answer to all of these is zero. Surely you agree that you would have lost money if
you'd bet on these with me in 1945?
Me: I agree I would have lost money on that bet. But I still feel that my overall
worldview of "people will do wild and reckless things" loses fewer Bayes points than
yours does. If we'd bet not just on outcomes but on questions like "will someone build
a doomsday machine" or "will countries take X measure to reduce the probability of
accidental nuclear war", I would have won money oﬀ you from almost all of those. My
worldview would have won most of the bets.
Them: Except for the only bet that is unambiguously connected to the thing we
actually care about.
Me: Yeah, but I don't know if I care about that? Like, maybe I would have assigned
30% to "no nuclear weapons would have been ﬁred", but it's not that bad to have
something 30% likely happen. Whereas I feel you would have assigned numbers like

5% to a bunch of reckless things that I would have assigned 30% to, which is a much
more egregious mistake.
Them: If you read actual writers at the time, like Bertrand Russell, they seem to imply
very small probabilities of the outcome which actually happened; I think you're being
a bit overly generous about how well you would have done.
Me: Fair.
Them: I feel like your worldview suggests that way more bad things should have
happened as a result of coordination failures than have actually happened. Like, I
don't think there are really examples of very bad things happening as a result of
coordination failures.
Me: ...what? What about climate change or state bioweapons programs or the
response to covid?
Them: Climate change isn't very important, it's only going to make the world a few
percent worse oﬀ.
Me: I agree, but ﬁrstly I don't think politicians know that, and secondly they're still
doing much less than would be optimal.
Them: I think we'd do better on problems with actual big stakes.
Me: I don't see any reason to believe that this is true. It doesn't seem that we did
noticeably better on nuclear weapons than on lower-stakes coordination problems.
Them: I think state bioweapons programs are another example of something where
nothing very bad has happened.
Me: What about if covid turns out to have been accidentally released from a
bioweapons lab?
Them: That will be an update for me.
Me: Why would that be an update? We already know that state bioweapons programs
have killed thousands of people with accidental releases, and there's no particular
reason that they couldn't cause worse disasters, and that international regulation has
failed to control that.
Them: [inaudible. I don't know how to rephrase the thing that people say at this point
in the conversation.]
Me: Do you have any criticisms of me that you want to ﬁnish up with?
Them: Yeah. I think you're overly focused on looking at the worst examples of
coordination failures, rather than trying to get a balanced sense of our overall
strengths and weaknesses. I also think you're overly focused on stories where things
sound like they should have gone terribly, and you're updating insuﬃciently on the
fact that for some reason, it always seems to go okay in the end; I think that you
should update towards the possibility that you're just really confused about how
dangerous things are.
I feel very confused here.

Reveal Culture
(crossposted from malcolmocean.com; originally published June 2015)
I have things to say about the Ask/Guess/Tell Cultures model, and an
addition/amendment to propose: Reveal Culture. Shifting cultures is hard, so what
you're about to read is not going to have a quality of "let's all go do this!" I do think
it's worth talking about a lot more, and working on gradually and creatively with
others who are game to experiment with culture-crafting.
This post is going to assume that you're familiar with the Ask/Guess Culture model at
the very least. I don't want to have to explain the whole concept from scratch. The
post is written with a Tell Culture familiar audience in mind, although I think it would
be worth reading without it. I will talk about each in turn and my understanding of how
they work, so you understanding them well is not a prerequisite for this post.
I do want to note that I think it makes more sense to talk about "ask cultures" or even
"Guess-based cultures" though, rather than in the singular. This is helpful for keeping
salient the fact that there are many very diﬀerent cultures built upon the platform of
Ask or of Guess.
So I'm going to use Majuscule Singular to talk about the platforms and lowercase
(usually plural) to talk about the cultures themselves. I think this is just good thinking
practice.
Why am I using a new term?
I want to talk about a new cultural platform: Reveal Culture.
It has similarities to Tell Culture, but I'm choosing a new name for three reasons:
because I think that people read a lot into the names (for example assuming
that if you ask a question then it must not be Guess Culture) (more on this as a
general issue)
I think the name "Reveal Culture" suits this particular thing better than "Tell"
(For what it's worth, I think that "Infer" probably suits Guess a lot better than
"Guess" does.)
I don't want people to associate what I'm putting out with those who are trying
to do Tell Culture with everybody just based on reading Brienne's post. A culture
doesn't shift overnight: the Reveal-based culture that I have experience with has
been working at this for over a decade (I've been involved for 3 years) and it's
still very much a work in progress.
I'll talk later about why I've chosen the name "Reveal". Right now I want to talk about
the structure of the models.
Why are they called "cultures" and not just
"styles" or "strategies"?

In internet discussions, there have been proposals to refer to Ask/Guess/Tell as
(variably) styles, strategies, skills, techniques, habits or something else (rather than
"cultures"). In some cases, I think that this suggestion arises out of an
oversimpliﬁcation of how they actually work, although Brienne pointed out to me that
there's at least one good reason to avoid the term 'culture': "because 'culture' is way
too close to 'tribe', and it makes people focus on cheering or defense."
Unfortunately, those other terms aren't suﬃciently complex to model the dynamics.
There are indeed skills and techniques associated with these diﬀerent cultures, but it's
not enough to have skills. Or even rules. Cultures are built on shared underlying
assumptions.
Ask cultures don't work if you're missing the part that says "it's totally 100% okay to
say no." The conversational strategies associated with ask cultures require that
shared assumption. All guess cultures, too, have shared assumptions at their core
(although perhaps very diﬀerent norms about how speciﬁc information is
communicated). As do reveal cultures.
These assumptions, laid out below, have to do with what you can trust in the other
person. To the extent possible, #1 in each case has to do with the other person's
needs/wants, and #2 has to do with your own needs.
Ask Culture assumptions of trust
1. "If you need or want something, I trust you to ask for it."
2. "If I make a request that doesn't make sense for you, I trust you to refuse it."
Guess Culture assumptions of trust
1. "I trust that you will give me appropriate hints about your needs and wants and I
trust myself to notice & interpret them."
2. "I trust you to notice my subtle cues (indirect language and nonverbals) to what
I may need or what, and to provide or oﬀer it if possible."
(Many Guess-based cultures perhaps have other assumptions that are founded in part
on the above two, such as "if you ask me directly for something, I assume that it's
either of grave importance or that you're expecting that the answer is an easy 'yes'.")
Reveal Culture assumptions of trust
1. "When you share information with me, I trust that you're doing so sincerely and
because you think it will be helpful for my model of you as a person and/or my
ability to navigate this situation."
2. "When I share information with you, I am trusting that even if it is diﬃcult for
you to hear, it won't overwhelm you—that you'll be able to process it and make
sense of it, possibly with help from me or others in our community."
I think that if you can't non-naively make these assumptions a decent amount of the
time, then you don't have a foundation for a Reveal-based culture. If, in a given
situation, for a given piece of information, you can't actually trust the #2 thing, then
you don't share that information.

So what about Tell Culture?
You may have noticed that the aforementioned Tell Culture wasn't included in my list
of assumptions of trust. I think that its assumptions are in theory about the same as
Reveal. But in practice, most people who think they're "doing Tell Culture" have been
holding assumptions that look much more like Ask Culture.
...which does not work very well. But that's what happening, and I'm not the only one
who's noticed.
Ben Compass Rose Hoﬀman wrote:
"Tell culture is a variant on ask culture where instead of just making a request, you
express the strength and exact nature of your preference, so other people can
respond to your needs cooperatively, balancing your interest against theirs, and
suggesting better alternatives for you to get what you want."
In case you missed it, let me repeat the ﬁrst 8 words of that:
"Tell culture is a variant on ask culture"
I expect that nobody would say that my assumptions written above for Ask and Reveal
sound like Reveal is just a variant on Ask.
But this is a common perception that people have come to have about Tell Culture.
And honestly, I think that if you're observing what lots of people are doing, it's a fairly
accurate assessment. If you take a bunch of asky people and you propose they try
"Tell Culture" as described, you'll basically get a culture that is still fundamentally
operating on Ask Culture assumptions, except where people use statements instead of
questions, and are a lot more blunt about their own perceived needs. (I'm not sure
what would happen with guessy people, but I'd be curious to ﬁnd out!)
So I'm going to use "Tell Culture" to refer to this thing where people are doing Ask
Culture but diﬀerently. Which, after all, is basically what the word already refers to for
most people who are familiar with it in practice. Which is maybe a thousand people at
most. (More like 10k-100k have read the LessWrong post, but I'm thinking only of
people who have actually had interactions that were seriously guided by the TC post)
Anyway, based on careful reading of the original article, as well as what Brienne has
published elsewhere and my personal conversations with her, I'm conﬁdent that that's
not how she is understanding Tell Culture. But that's the experience that a lot of
people are having.
What experience are people having of Tell
Culture?
After the original Tell Culture article went up, a lot of people in my circles in the SF Bay
Area became attracted to the idea of Tell Culture as a mode of communication, and
began trying to use it. And I'm all for trying new things! But as I've said above, you
need to have the corresponding assumptions in place for it to work. And the
assumptions are about trust, which has to be created, not taken for granted.

Yet people are presuming that they can use the communication style and in some
cases expecting it to be reciprocated, even though the trust isn't there. A mutual
friend of ours wrote:
As Tell Culture was becoming more popular in Berkeley, due to people mostly
being excited about the bit in the name, it felt a good deal like I'd had Crocker's
Rules declared upon me at all times without my opt in.
You can declare yourself to be operating by certain rules. Crocker's Rules means
declaring "don't worry about oﬀending me, just give it to me straight." You can't
declare trust.
(Aside: if someone you knew to be really sensitive, insecure & reactive announced
that they wanted blunt feedback because Crocker's Rules, you might still not actually
trust them to eﬀectively handle blunt feedback, and therefore you might not give it,
depending on your prediction of the impact. This is sane. If possible, you'd probably at
least try to get out of the double bind by giving them the probably-challenging
feedback that you don't feel able to take them up on their declaration of Crocker's
Rules in general. See also my article on Crocker's Rules as a hack for simulating deep
trust.)
To compare, imagine if a bunch of Guess Culture people decided they wanted to
switch to predominantly ask-style communication. So they start asking each other for
things more often, and they start saying no more often. Sometimes. But if some
people are still carrying guess-assumptions, then either they won't really be able to
refuse requests, or they won't be able to comfortably allow others to refuse. And this,
naturally, breaks Ask Culture. Because if you can't actually trust that people will ask
for what they need and refuse requests that don't work for them, then you need to
start inferring/guessing again.
So what about the Reveal Culture assumptions? Can we adopt those? Some of us,
perhaps, with some people we know. It can take as much inference skill as is needed
to ﬂourish in a guess culture to know what actually makes sense to say, to a given
person, at a given moment.
But not everybody. The topvoted comment on the Tell Culture LW article says:
Tragedy of the commons, the shared resource being mutual trust. The ﬁrst one to
defect reaps the rewards of his faux signals being taken at face value, [...]
degrading the network of trust a "tell culture" relies upon.
The assumptions that that commenter is making are incompatible with the Reveal
Culture assumptions. The main issue that stands out to me is that they are assuming
that that the system operates primarily with a zero- or negative-sum payoﬀ matrix,
and that it is therefore possible to "defect" and achieve personal gain at the expense
of the group. This is true in lots of contexts, and arguably Reveal Culture therefore
doesn't totally work there. But that doesn't mean it can't work somewhere.
Ben Hoﬀman agrees with me that Reveal Culture assumptions imply a positively-
correlated model of interpersonal engagement—your beneﬁt is a beneﬁt for me, and
vice versa. Given that, of course I want to give you more information, and true
information. Not all information, because that's obviously impossible, so I'm going to
end up choosing. Factors that aﬀect the decision-making would include:
what is the point of the interaction?

how relevant is that information to the situation at hand?
how much time do we have?
what is our relationship like?
what kind of state are each of us in?
how much emotional capacity do you appear to have to handle what I might
say?
...and I think that in a lot of cases, you end up realizing that it actually doesn't make
sense to reveal something. I've written about what it's like to get over fear-of-
revealing though so that you can actually assess that question more rationally. And
building deeper trust between people—not just you and the particular person you're
talking to, but the whole community/context within which your relationship exists—
helps to make it possible to safely err on the side of revealing too much. But if you
don't have that trust, then it won't work.
In closing: Why "Reveal" Culture?
Because the relevant information is internal.
Because "reveal" speaks to the vulnerability that is involved, even if you're in a
positive-sum context.
Because you can tell someone to do something, but you can't reveal someone to do
something.
Because rather than throwing something at someone and putting the burden on them
to deal with what they've just been told, "reveal" evokes an image of someone
sharing something carefully, while holding it close to themselves, letting the other
person look at it only as much as they want to.


High Stock Prices Make Sense Right Now
I've been seeing a lot of comments lately about how the ﬁnancial markets have gone
completely wonky, eﬃcient markets hypothesis looks crazy right now, etc. I don't currently
trade actively and haven't run a lot of numbers, but just in terms of big-picture qualitative
behavior, high stock prices make a lot of sense right now. This post is an informal
explanation of why.
First, let's forget about the eﬃcient market price formula (i.e. price = expected sum of
discounted future cash ﬂows, VT = E[∑t>T e−R
t
T Ct]). I'll talk about that a bit at the end, but it's
so widely and severely misunderstood that I'd need a whole post just to correct
misconceptions. Instead, we'll start from ﬁrst principles: ﬁnancial capital is a good, just like
any other good. Its price is determined by supply and demand, just like any other good.
When stock prices are high, that means ﬁnancial capital is cheap for companies: they can
get a lot of capital by issuing a lot of stock. High stock price = cheap capital. Likewise with
bonds: when bond prices are high, yields are low, meaning companies can borrow capital
very cheaply.
What makes the cost of ﬁnancial capital move? Well, the usual supply-and-demand
reasoning:
If people suddenly ﬁnd themselves with lots of extra savings to invest, that means the
supply of ﬁnancial capital increases, and the cost of ﬁnancial capital should fall (i.e.
stock prices rise).
If people expect lower returns in the future, they will want to invest less, so the supply
of ﬁnancial capital decreases, and the cost of ﬁnancial capital should rise (i.e. stock
prices fall).
If there's a credit crunch and companies suddenly need to borrow lots of money on
short notice, then the demand for ﬁnancial capital increases, so the cost of ﬁnancial
capital should rise (i.e. stock prices fall).
If many companies are suddenly ﬂush with cash, then the demand for ﬁnancial capital
decreases, so the cost of ﬁnancial capital should fall (i.e. stock prices rise).
This should all be pretty intuitive, and you can probably brainstorm a few more examples
along these lines.
Now, what's been going on lately, and how does it ﬁt into this picture?
Expectations of future earnings are generally down (although mostly just in the short term).
Many companies suddenly need to borrow money in order to stay in business until the storm
passes. On their own, these two factors should both push stock prices down: supply of
ﬁnancial capital should be low, and demand for ﬁnancial capital should be high.
The size of both of these changes are big, but not too far out of line with a normal business
cycle slowdown. They are signiﬁcant, but not huge by historical standards. On the other
hand, there has been one ridiculously huge delta which utterly dwarfs any fast change we've
seen in economic fundamentals in the last seventy years:

That's the personal savings rate - the amount people save, relative to their disposable
income. Given how the modern ﬁnancial system works, that's basically the supply of
ﬁnancial capital. It quadrupled in a month.
Even if people were nervous enough about the recovery to allocate half as large a share of
marginal savings to stocks as they were a year ago, even if real disposable income were
down (it's actually up, courtesy of stimulus payments), that would still be a near-2x increase
in marginal savings allocated to stocks. That jump in the personal savings rate is ridiculously
larger than any change in economic fundamentals in living memory; it shouldn't be
surprising if it completely dominates market behavior.
What About That Formula?
Warning: more math and jargon past this point.
Ok, now we've talked about ﬁrst principles. Hopefully it all makes intuitive sense. How does it
square with VT = Et[∑t>T e−R
t
T Ct]?
The key questions are: what's that discounting rate R, and what distribution is the
expectation over?
Many people will say it's the "risk-free rate", i.e. yield on Treasury bonds, but those same
people will outright admit that this does not actually work. It predicts prices far higher than
actual stock prices, and says that people ought to sell treasuries in order to buy stock.
Obviously people don't do that, because we're not risk-neutral (nor should we be). The whole
notion of R being the risk-free rate is based on a dumb argument that nobody actually buys.
Some people who've seen some math ﬁnance may talk about the "risk-neutral distribution"
and corresponding discount rate. These are great tools for pricing derivatives, but they're
severely underdetermined for problems like "determine stock price from fundamentals".
They just assert the existence of some distribution and discount rate which make the formula
work; they say nothing at all about what the distribution and rate should be.
To get a proper foundation for the pricing formula, we need to go to ﬁnancial economics. John
Cochrane (aka The Grumpy Economist)  has a pretty decent book on the subject; he gives
the economist's simplest version of the pricing formula at the very beginning:
V t = E t [ β 
  C t + 1 ]
u ′ ( c t + 1 )
u ′ ( c t )

Here the "discount rate" e−R
t+1
t
 for the timestep t →t + 1 is the magic expression β
.
What is that?
ct is the amount the investor consumes at time t - i.e. if this is a retirement portfolio,
it's the amount taken out.
u is the investor's single-time-step utility function, and u′ is its derivative with respect
to amount consumed.
β is the investor's own discount factor, i.e. how much they value consumption
tomorrow relative to today.
Note that I keep saying "the investor" here - this formula is for one single investor! We
don't need to assume that all investors are expected discounted utility
maximizers. If any investor acts like an expected discounted utility maximizer, then the
formula applies for that investor's discount rate, utility function, and expectations. The
formula comes directly from the investor's own utility-maximization condition.
(Side-note: I actually don't like the formulation in which the investor has an explicit time-
discount with consumption each time step; I prefer to have the investor just maximize
expected utility at some far-future timestep with exogenous cash-ﬂows along the way, as a
more accurate model of something like e.g. a retirement fund. For current purposes, the
results are quite similar. Take-away: the things we're saying here are not too highly sensitive
to the model setup.)
Now, if you followed that, you're probably thinking "Huh?? That means prices have to satisfy
diﬀerent eﬃcient pricing formulas for diﬀerent investors. But they're the same prices!".
That's right. The trick is, each investor will adjust their portfolio and their consumption ct to
make their equation hold. This formula isn't for predicting prices, it's for predicting how
much of each asset the investor holds going into the next timestep.
If we want to use the formula to predict prices, then we have two options.
The hard (but right) way: compute the whole equilibrium for all the investors.
The easier (but unreliable) way: notice that the consumption, distribution and discount
rate for most investors seem to follow pretty stable patterns, then assume that those
patterns hold and ask what price that implies.
Most usages of the pricing formula are ultimately equivalent to the second, with various
ﬂavors of ﬁrst-order corrections thrown in. That works as long as the investor fundamentals
are stable, but if there's a big change in investor characteristics - like, say, a giant jump in
the savings rate (i.e. a drop in consumption) - then obviously it falls apart.

The Equation of Knowledge
My book The Equation of Knowledge has just been published at CRC Press, and I'm
guessing that it may be of interest to readers of LessWrong. The book aims to be a
somewhat accessible and very complete introduction to Bayesianism. No prior
knowledge is needed; though some sections require an important familiarity with
mathematics and computer science. The book has been designed so that these
sections can be skipped without hindering the reading.
The aim of the book is to (1) highlight the most compelling arguments, theorems and
empirical evidence in favor of Bayesianism, (2) present numerous applications in a
very wide variety of domains, and (3) discuss solutions for pragmatic Bayesianism
with limited computational resources. Please ﬁnd here a promotional 5-minute video
of the book.
In this post, I will brieﬂy sketch the outline of the book. Just like the book, I'll divide the
post in four sections.
Pure Bayesianism
The ﬁrst section of the book is a gentle introduction to pure Bayesianism, which is
deﬁned as obeying strictly to the laws of probability theory. The key equation is
evidently Bayes rule, which I like to write as follows:
P[T|D] =
.
This equation says that the critical variable is P[T|D], that is, the credence of theory T
given data D. Computing this is arguably the end goal of Bayes rule. Bayes rule thus
does not quite aim to distinguish truth from falsehood; it rather motivates us to assign
quantitative measures of reliability to diﬀerent theories, given observed data. It
suggests that we should replace questions like "is T true?" by "how credible is T?" (or
perhaps even by "how much should I trust the predictions of theory T?"). I argue in
the book that this is a great way to improve the quality of many debates.
Bayes rule then goes on telling us how to compute the credence of a theory given
empirical data. Importantly, on the right hand side, we have the term P[T] which
measures the credence of the theory prior to the observation of data D. This is critical.
A theory which was extremely unlikely before we knew D will likely remain unlikely
even given D, unless D is overwhelmingly compelling. This corresponds to Carl
Sagan's phrase "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" (which was
analyzed mathematically by Laplace back in 1814!).
P[D|T]P[T]
P[D|T]P[T]+∑A≠T P[D|A]P[A]

Bayes rule then tells us to update our prior beliefs P[T] based on observed data D
depending on how well theory T predicts data D. Essentially, we can see any theory T
as a betting individual. If T bets on D, which corresponds to a large value of P[D|T],
then it should gain credence in T. But if theory T found observed data D unlikely (i.e. 
P[D|T] ≈0), then we should decrease our belief in T once we observe D.
Well, actually, Bayes rule tells us that this update also depends on how well
alternative theories A perform. Indeed, the denominator P[D|T]P[T] + ∑A≠T P[D|A]P[A]
orchestrates a sort of competition between the diﬀerent theories. In particular, the
credence of theory T will be decreasing only if its bet P[D|T] is outperformed by the
bets P[D|A] of alternative theories A. In particular, this means that Bayes rule forbids
the analysis of a theory independently of others; the credence of a theory is only
relative to the set of alternatives.
Chapters 2 to 5 of the book details the analysis of Bayes rule, and illustrates it through
a large number of examples, like Sally Clark's infamous lawsuit, Hempel's raven
paradox, Einstein's discovery of general relativity and the Linda problem, among
many other examples. They also draw connections and tensions with ﬁrst-order logic,
Popper's falsiﬁability and null hypothesis statistical tests.
Chapter 6 then discusses the history of Bayesianism, which also hints at the
importance of probability theory in essentially all human endeavors. Finally, Chapter 7
concludes the ﬁrst part of the book, by introducing Solomonoﬀ's induction, which I call
pure Bayesianism. In brief, Bayes rule requires any theory T to bet on any imaginable
observable data D (formally, T needs to deﬁne a probability measure on the space of
data, otherwise the quantity P[D|T] is ill-deﬁned). Solomonoﬀ's genius was to simply
also demand this bet to be computable. It turns out that the rest of Solomonoﬀ's
theory essentially beautifully falls out from this simple additional constraint.
Evidently, a lot more explanations and details can be found in the book!
Applied Bayesianism
The second section of the book goes deeper into applications of Bayesianism to
numerous diﬀerent ﬁelds. Chapter 8 discusses the strong connection between
Bayesianism and privacy. After all, if Bayesianism is the right theory of knowledge, it is
clearly critical to any theory on how to prevent knowledge. And indeed, the leading
concept of privacy, namely diﬀerential privacy, has a very natural deﬁnition in terms
of probability theory.
Chapter 9 dwells on the strong connection between Bayesianism and economics, and
in particular game theory. Nobel prize winner Roger Myerson once argued that "the

unity and scope of modern information economics was found in Harsanyi's
framework". Again, this can be made evident by the fact that much of modern
economics focuses on the consequences of incomplete (e.g. asymmetric) information.
Chapter 10 moves on to the surprisingly strong connections between Darwinian
evolution and Bayes rule. In particular, the famous Lotka-Volterra equations for
population dynamics features an intriguing resemblance with Bayes rule. This
resemblance is then exploited to discuss to which extent the spread of ideas within
the scientiﬁc community can be compared to the growth of the credence in a theory
for a Bayesian. This allows to identify reliable rules of thumbs to determine when a
scientiﬁc consensus or a (predictive) market prize is credible, and when they are less
so.
Chapter 11 discusses exponential growths, which emerge out of repeated
multiplications. Such growths are critical to understand to have an intuitively feel for
Bayes rule, as repeated Bayesian updates are typically multiplicative. The chapter
also draws a fascinating connection between the multiplicative weights update
algorithm and variants like Adaboost, and Bayes rule. It argues that the success of
these methods is no accident; and that their late discovery may be due to
mathematicians' poor intuitive understanding of exponential growth.
Chapter 12 presents numerous applications of Ockham's razor to avoid erroneous
conclusions. It also shows that the practical usefulness of Ockham's razor is intimately
connected to the importance of priors in Bayesian thinking, as evidenced by the
compelling theorem that says that, under mild assumptions, only Bayesian methods
are "statistically admissible". Finally, the chapter concludes with another stunning
theorem: it can be proved in one line that a version of Ockham's razor is a theorem
under Bayesianism (I'll keep this one line secret to tease you!).
Chapter 13 then stresses the danger of Simpson's paradox and the importance of
confounding variables when analyzing empirical uncontrolled data. After discussing
the value and limits of randomized controlled tests, I then reformulate the necessary
analysis of plausible confounding variables for data analysis as the unavoidability of
priors to think correctly. The chapter closes with some philosophical discussions on the
ontology of these confounding variables.
Pragmatic Bayesianism
Unfortunately, pure Bayesianism demands unreasonable computational capabilities.
Nor our brains nor our machines have access to such capabilities. As a result, in
practice, pure Bayesianism is doomed to fail. In other words, we cannot obey strictly
the laws of probability. We'll have to content ourselves with approximations of these
laws.
Chapter 14 contextualizes this strategy under the more general theory of
computational complexity. It gives numerous examples where this strategy has been
used, for instance to study prime numbers or Ramsey theory. It also presents Turing's
1950 compelling argument for the need of machine learning to achieve human-level
AI, based on computational complexity. The chapter also draws connection with
Kahneman's System 1 / System 2 model.
Chapter 15 then stresses the need to embrace (quantitative) uncertainty. It provides
numerous arguments for why this uncertainty will always remain, from chaos theory

to quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and automata with irreducible
computations. It then discusses ways to measure success under uncertainty, using
cross-entropy for instance, or more general proper scoring rules. Finally it draws
connections with modern machine learning, in particular generative adversarial
networks (GANs).
Chapter 16 then discusses the challenges posed by having limited information storage
spaces, both from a computational and from a cognitive perspective. The chapter
discusses things like Kalman ﬁlters, false memory, recurrent neural network, attention
mechanisms and what should be taught in our modern world, where we can now
exploit much better information storage systems than our brains.
Chapter 17 discusses approximations of Bayes rule using sampling. It is a gentle
introduction to Monte-Carlo methods, and then to Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC)
methods. It then argues that our brains probably run MCMC-like algorithms, and
discusses the consequences on cognitive biases. Indeed, MCMC only has asymptotic
guarantees; but if MCMC does not run for long, it will be heavily biased by its starting
point. Arguably, something similar occurs in our brains.
Chapter 18 addresses a fundamental question of epistemology, namely the
unreasonable eﬀectiveness of abstraction. This chapter draws heavily on theoretical
computer science, and in particular on Kolmogorov sophistication and Bennett logical
depth, to suggest explanations of the success of abstractions based on computational
properties of our current universe. It is interesting to note that, in the far past or the
very far future, the state of the universe may be such that deep abstraction would be
unlikely to remain useful (and thus "eﬀective").
Chapter 19 introduces the Bayesian brain hypothesis, and the numerous fascinating
recent discoveries of cognitive sciences in this regard. Amazingly, Bayes rule has been
suggested again and again to explain our vulnerability to optical illusions, our ability
to generalize from few examples or babies' learning capabilities. The Bayesian
perspective has fascinating consequences on the famous Nature vs Nurture debate.
Beyond Bayesianism
The last section of the book takes a bit of distance from Bayesianism, though it is still
strongly connected to the laws of probability. Chapter 20 discusses what I argue to be
natural consequences of pure Bayesian thinking on scientiﬁc realism. In particular, it
argues that theories are mostly tools to predict past and future data. As a result, it
seems pointless to argue about the truth of their components; what matters rather
seems to be the usefulness of thinking with these components. I discuss
consequences on how we ought to discuss concepts like money, life or electrons.
Chapter 21 is my best eﬀort to encourage readers to question their most strongly held
beliefs. It does so by providing the examples of my own journey, and by stressing the
numerous cognitive biases that I have been suﬀering. It then goes on underlining
what seems to me to be the key reasons of my progress towards Bayesianism, namely
the social and informational environment I have been so lucky to end up in. Improving
this environment may indeed be key for anyone to question their most strongly held
beliefs.
Finally, Chapter 22 brieﬂy goes beyond epistemology to enter the realm of moral
philosophy. After discussions on the importance of descriptive moral theories to

understand human interactions, the chapter gives a brief classical introduction of the
main moral theories, in particular deontology and utilitarianism. It then argues that
consequentialism somehow generalizes these theories, but that only Bayesian
consequentialism is consistent with the laws of probability. It then illustrates decision-
making under Bayesian consequentialism with examples, and stresses the importance
of catastrophic events, as long as their probability is not suﬃciently negligible.
One last thing I'd add is that I have made a lot of eﬀort to make the book enjoyable. It
is written in a very informal style, often with personal examples. I have also made a
lot of eﬀort to share complex ideas with a lot of enthusiasm, not because it makes
them more convincing, but because it seems necessary to me to motivate the readers
to really ponder these complex ideas.
Finally, note that French-speaking readers can also watch the series of videos I've
made on Bayesianism on YouTube!

Learning the prior
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
Suppose that I have a dataset D of observed (x, y) pairs, and I'm interested in
predicting the label y* for each point x* in some new set D*. Perhaps D is a set of
forecasts from the last few years, and D* is a set of questions about the coming years
that are important for planning.
The classic deep learning approach is to ﬁt a model f on D, and then predict y*
using f(x*).
This approach implicitly uses a somewhat strange prior, which depends on exactly
how I optimize f. I may end up with the model with the smallest l2 norm, or the model
that's easiest to ﬁnd with SGD, or the model that's most robust to dropout. But none
of these are anywhere close to the "ideal" beliefs of a human who has updated on D.
This means that neural nets are unnecessarily data hungry, and more importantly that
they can generalize in an undesirable way. I now think that this is a safety problem, so
I want to try to attack it head on by learning the "right" prior, rather than attempting
to use neural nets as an implicit prior.
Warm-up 1: human forecasting
If D and D* are small enough, and I'm OK with human-level forecasts, then I don't
need ML at all.
Instead I can hire a human to look at all the data in D, learn all the relevant lessons
from it, and then spend some time forecasting y* for each x*.
Now let's gradually relax those assumptions.
Warm-up 2: predicting human forecasts
Suppose that D* is large but that D is still small enough that a human can extract all
the relevant lessons from it (or that for each x* in D*, there is a small subset of D that
is relevant).
In this case, I can pay humans to make forecasts for many randomly chosen x* in D*,
train a model f to predict those forecasts, and then use f to make forecasts about the
rest of D*.
The generalization is now coming entirely from human beliefs, not from the structural
of the neural net — we are only applying neural nets to iid samples from D*.
Learning the human prior
Now suppose that D is large, such that a human can't update on it themselves.
Perhaps D contains billions of examples, but we only have time to let a human read a
few pages of background material.

Instead of learning the unconditional human forecast P(y|x), we will learn the forecast
P(y|x, Z), where Z is a few pages of background material that the human takes as
given. We can also query the human for the prior probability Prior(Z) that the
background material is true.
Then we can train f(y|x, Z) to match P(y|x, Z), and optimize Z* for:
log Prior(Z*) + sum((x, y) ~ D) log f(y|x, Z*)
We train f in parallel with optimizing Z*, on inputs consisting of the current value of Z*
together with questions x sampled from D and D*.
For example, Z might specify a few explicit models for forecasting and trend
extrapolation, a few important background assumptions, and guesses for a wide range
of empirical parameters. Then a human who reads Z can evaluate how plausible it is
on its face, or they can take it on faith in order to predict y* given x*.
The optimal Z* is then the set of assumptions, models, and empirical estimates that
works best on the historical data. The human never has to reason about more than
one datapoint at a time — they just have to evaluate what Z* implies about each
datapoint in isolation, and evaluate how plausible Z* is a priori.
This approach has many problems. Two particularly important ones:
To be competitive, this optimization problem needs to be nearly as easy as
optimizing f directly on D, but it seems harder: ﬁnding Z* might be much harder
than learning f, learning a conditional f might be much harder than learning an
unconditional f, and jointly optimizing Z and f might present further diﬃculties.
Even if it worked our forecasts would only be "human-level" in a fairly restrictive
sense — they wouldn't even be as good as a human who actually spent years
practicing on D before making a forecast on D*. To be competitive, we want the
forecasts in the iid case to be at least as good as ﬁtting a model directly.
I think the ﬁrst point is an interesting ML research problem. (If anything resembling
this approach ever works in practice, credit will rightly go to the researchers who
ﬁgure out the precise version that works and resolve those issues, and this blog post
will be a footnote.) I feel relatively optimistic about our collective ability to solve
concrete ML problems, unless they turn out to be impossible. I'll give some
preliminary thoughts in the next section "Notes & elaborations."
The second concern, that we need some way to go beyond human level, is a central
philosophical issue and I'll return to it in the subsequent section "Going beyond the
human prior."
Notes & elaborations
Searching over long texts may be extremely diﬃcult. One idea to avoid this is to
try to have a human guide the search, by either generating hypotheses Z at
random or sampling perturbations to the current value of Z. Then we can ﬁt a
generative model of that exploration process and perform search in the latent
space (and also ﬁt f in the latent space rather than having it take Z as input).
That rests on two hopes: (i) learning the exploration model is easy relative to the
other optimization we are doing, (ii) searching for Z in the latent space of the

human exploration process is strictly easier than the corresponding search over
neural nets. Both of those seem quite plausible to me.
We don't necessarily need to learn f everywhere, it only needs to be valid in a
small neighborhood of the current Z. That may not be much harder than learning
the unconditional f.
Z represents a full posterior rather than a deterministic "hypothesis" about the
world, e.g. it might say "R0 is uniform between 2 and 3." What I'm calling
Prior(Z) is really the KL between the prior and Z, and P(y|x,Z) will itself reﬂect
the uncertainty in Z. The motivation is that we want a ﬂexible and learnable
posterior. (This is particularly valuable once we go beyond human level.)
This formulation queries the human for Prior(Z) before each ﬁtness evaluation.
That might be ﬁne, or you might need to learn a predictor of that judgment. It
might be easier for a human to report a ratio Prior(Z)/Prior(Z′) than to give an
absolute prior probability, but that's also ﬁne for optimization. I think there are a
lot of diﬃculties of this ﬂavor that are similar to other eﬀorts to learn
from humans.
For the purpose of studying the ML optimization diﬃculties I think we can
basically treat the human as an oracle for a reasonable prior. We will then need
to relax that rationality assumption in the same way we do for other instances of
learning from humans (though a lot of the work will also be done by our eﬀorts
to go beyond the human prior, described in the next section).
Going beyond the human prior
How do we get predictions better than explicit human reasoning?
We need to have a richer latent space Z, a better Prior(Z), and a better conditional
P(y|x, Z).
Instead of having a human predict y given x and Z, we can use ampliﬁcation or debate
to train f(y|x, Z) and Prior(Z). This allows Z to be a large object that cannot be directly
accessed by a human.
For example, Z might be a full library of books describing important facts about the
world, heuristics, and so on. Then we may have two powerful models debating "What
should we predict about x, assuming that everything in Z is true?" Over the course of
that debate they can cite small components of Z to help make their case, without the
human needing to understand almost anything written in Z.
In order to make this approach work, we need to do a lot of things:
1. We still need to deal with all the ML diﬃculties described in the preceding
section.
2. We still need to analyze debate/ampliﬁcation, and now we've increased the
problem diﬃculty slightly. Rather than merely requiring them to produce the
"right" answers to questions, we also need them to implement the "right" prior.
We already needed to implement the right prior as part of answering questions
correctly, so this isn't too much of a strengthening, but we are calling attention
to a particularly challenging case. It also imposes a particular structure on that
reasoning which is a real (but hopefully slight) strengthening.
3. Entangled with the new analysis of ampliﬁcation/debate, we also need to ensure
that Z is able to represent a rich enough latent space. I'll discuss implicit
representations of Z in the next section "Representing Z."

4. Representing Z implicitly and using ampliﬁcation or debate may make the
optimization problem even more diﬃcult. I'll discuss this in the subsequent
section "Jointly optimizing Mz and f."
Representing Z
I've described Z as being a giant string of text. If debate/ampliﬁcation work at all then
I think text is in some sense "universal," so this isn't a crazy restriction.
That said, representing complex beliefs might require very long text, perhaps many
orders of magnitude larger than the model f itself. That means that optimizing for (Z,
f) jointly will be much harder than optimizing for f alone.
The approach I'm most optimistic about is representing Z implicitly as the output of
another model Mz. For example, if Z is a text that is trillions of words long, you could
have Mz output the ith word of Z on input i.
(To be really eﬃcient you'll need to share parameters between f and Mz but that's not
the hard part.)
This can get around the most obvious problem — that Z is too long to possibly write
down in its entirety — but I think you actually have to be pretty careful about the
implicit representation or else we will make Mz's job too hard (in a way that will be
tied up the competitiveness of debate/ampliﬁcation).
In particular, I think that representing Z as implicit ﬂat text is unlikely to be workable.
I'm more optimistic about the kind of approach described in approval-maximizing
representations — Z is a complex object that can be related to slightly simpler objects,
which can themselves be related to slightly simpler objects... until eventually
bottoming out with something simple enough to be read directly by a human. Then Mz
implicitly represents Z as an exponentially large tree, and only needs to be able to do
one step of unpacking at a time.
Jointly optimizing Mz and f
In the ﬁrst section I discussed a model where we learn f(y|x, Z) and then use it to
optimize Z. This is harder if Z is represented implicitly by Mz, since we can't really
aﬀord to let f take Mz as input.
I think the most promising approach is to have Mz and f both operate on a compact
latent space, and perform optimization in this space. I mention that idea in Notes &
Elaborations above, but want to go into more detail now since it gets a little more
complicated and becomes a more central part of the proposal.
(There are other plausible approaches to this problem; having more angles of attack
makes me feel more comfortable with the problem, but all of the others feel less
promising to me and I wanted to keep this blog post a bit shorter.)
The main idea is that rather than training a model Mz(·) which implicitly represents Z,
we train a model Mz(·, z) which implicitly represents a distribution over Z,
parameterized by a compact latent z.
Mz is trained by iterated ampliﬁcation to imitate a superhuman exploration
distribution, analogous to the way that we could ask a human to sample Z and then

train a generative model of the human's hypothesis-generation. Training Mz this way
is itself an open ML problem, similar to the ML problem of making iterated
ampliﬁcation work for question-answering.
Now we can train f(y|x, z) using ampliﬁcation or debate. Whenever we would want to
reference Z, we use Mz(·, z). Similarly, we can train Prior(z). Then we choose z* to
optimize log Prior(z*) + sum((x, y) ~ D) log f(y|x, z*).
Rather than ending up with a human-comprehensible posterior Z*, we'll end up with a
compact latent z*. The human-comprehensible posterior Z* is implemented implicitly
by Mz(·, z*).
Outlook
I think the approach in this post can potentially resolve the issue described in
Inaccessible Information, which I think is one of the largest remaining conceptual
obstacles for ampliﬁcation/debate. So overall I feel very excited about it.
Taking this approach means that ampliﬁcation/debate need to meet a slightly higher
bar than they otherwise would, and introduces a bit of extra philosophical diﬃculty. It
remains to be seen whether ampliﬁcation/debate will work at all, much less whether
they can meet this higher bar. But overall I feel pretty excited about this outcome,
since I was expecting to need a larger reworking of ampliﬁcation/debate.
I think it's still very possible that the approach in this post can't work for fundamental
philosophical reasons. I'm not saying this blog post is anywhere close to a convincing
argument for feasibility.
Even if the approach in this post is conceptually sound, it involves several serious ML
challenges. I don't see any reason those challenges should be impossible, so I feel
pretty good about that — it always seems like good news when you can move from
philosophical diﬃculty to technical diﬃculty. That said, it's still quite possible that one
of these technical issues will be a fundamental deal-breaker for competitiveness.
My current view is that we don't have candidate obstructions for ampliﬁcation/debate
as an approach to AI alignment, though we have a lot of work to do to actually ﬂesh
those out into a workable approach. This is a more optimistic place than I was at a
month ago when I wrote Inaccessible Information.
Learning the prior was originally published in AI Alignment on Medium, where people
are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.

What should we do about network-
eﬀect monopolies?
Many large companies today are software monopolies that give their product away for
free to get monopoly status, then do the most horrible things once they've won.
(Previously, previously.) Can we do anything about this?
Unfortunately, "you're the product" is a popular business model for a reason:
businesses like Facebook would be really hard to support without them.
Facebook would be suicidal to charge its users money, because its entire selling point
is that everyone uses it, and "everyone" hates paying money. In the US, Facebook
makes over $40 per person on ads (source). Can you imagine if instead of ads they
tried to charge people $40 a year?
Even on the margin, anything that costs Facebook users also makes it less valuable for
its remaining users—it's a negative feedback loop. The same goes for any other site
where users create value for other users, like Twitter or Craigslist or Yelp or Wikipedia.
(It's not an accident that these are some of the most stagnant popular websites!)
In fact, this is a fundamental problem with network eﬀects. If a company wants to
maintain a network eﬀect, they need as many users as possible. To get users, they
have to have a free product. To keep their product free, they have to get paid by
someone else. And when they start getting paid by someone else, they'll inevitably
start prioritizing that person's interests.
Historically with other network-eﬀect businesses, we've mostly addressed this via:
regulation (e.g. local utilities)
breakups (e.g. Bell)
standardization and interoperability (e.g. email, the Web, cryptocurrency)
So far for tech monopolies, people seem to be focused mostly on breakups—e.g.
Facebook from Instagram/Whatsapp—but standardization seems to have produced
much better outcomes in the past. (I like email and the Web a lot more than National
Grid...) I'd be interested to see more exploration of that option!

Kelly Bet on Everything
Cross-posted, as always, from Putanumonit.
It's a core staple of Putanumonit to apply ideas from math and ﬁnance out of context
to your everyday life. Finance is about making bets, but so is everything else. And one
of the most useful concepts related to making bets is the Kelly criterion.
It states that when facing a series of proﬁtable bets, your wagers should grow
proportionally with your bankroll and with your edge on each bet. Speciﬁcally, that
you should bet a percentage of your bankroll equivalent to your expected edge — if a
bet has a 55% chance to go your way your edge is 55%-45%=10% and you should
risk 10% of your bankroll on it (assuming equal amounts wagered and won). There
could be reasons to avoid betting the full Kelly in practice: you're not sure what your
edge is, your bet size is limited, etc. But it's a good guide nevertheless.
People's intuition is usually that Kelly bets are too aggressive, that betting half of
everything you have a on 75%-25% bet is too wild. But the Kelly criterion is actually
quite conservative in that it maximizes not the expected size of your bankroll but it's
expected logarithm. "Exponential" means "fast and crazy";  logarithm is the inverse of
that. It's slow and cautious. If you have $1,000 and you'd risk no more than $750 for
an equal chance to win $3,000, you're logarithmic in dollars and should "bet the
Kelly".
Log scales apply to the diﬃculty and value you get for most things. Life satisfaction
grows with log(money).  Making a new friend is probably one tenth as valuable to
someone who has 10 friends than to someone who has one, so your social life
depends on log(friends). It's equally hard to double one's number of blog readers,
sexual partners, job oﬀers etc regardless of how many you have, as opposed to
incrementing each by a ﬁxed amount. It's equally valuable too.
And so, for most things, it makes sense to bet the Kelly. You'll need to ﬁnd out what
bets are available, where your edge is, and what your bankroll is.
Money
Let's start with the obvious one. What kind of Kelly bets can you make with money?
Investments are the obvious one, and standard investment advice is to switch to high-
risk-high-return assets when you have some money to spare.
You can also make bets on your ability to make money: take on a side project, look for
a new job, start your own business, ask for a raise. Each one entails a risk and a
possible reward. Your bankroll is your literal bankroll, your edge is your ability to make
money for yourself or your employer.
People have a tendency to think that if they're paid $N a month their value to their
employer is something like N and half, but that often way oﬀ. Some people are worth
less than what they are paid, but are kept around because their boss can't tell. Some
people are worth 10x their salary — an employer has no reason to pay you more if you

don't ask for it. I quit a job once and immediately got oﬀered a 30% raise to come
back. I did some math on what I'm worth, gambled on asking for 50%, and got it.
Friends
When your friendships are few and tenuous, people's inclination is to play it safe and
conform to the crowd. It won't make you a social star, but it won't turn people away
either. But if you have an edge in popularity and enough close friends to fall back on
you can make some bets on your own vision.
When I was younger and struggled to make friends I'd just wait to be invited to
parties. When I ﬁnally ﬁgured it out and acquired a rich social life I started throwing
my own events the way I like them: controversial topic parties, naked retreats in the
woods, psychedelic rationality workshops. Each one is a gamble — the event could fail
or people could just not show up. In either case I'd lose some of the status and
goodwill that allowed me to plan those events in the ﬁrst place. But when it works the
payoﬀ is equally great.
Creative Talent
Whatever creative outlet you have, you get better by getting feedback from the
audience. Show people your paintings, read them your poems, invite them to your
shows, link them to your blog. This is a gamble — if people don't like what you're
making you won't get their attention next time.
When I just arrived in NYC I was doing stand-up and would perform at bringer shows
where you get stage time if you bring 3 or 4 paying guests. My ability to do that
depended on the number of friends willing to humor me (bankroll) and my humor
(edge). By the time I got decent enough to get an invite to a non-bringer show I had
just about run out of comedy-tolerating friends to call on.
Romance
The most obvious way to bet on yourself in romance is to ﬂirt with people "outside of
your league", your bankroll being in part your ability take rejection in stride and stay
single for longer. The same applies the other way, with making the bet on breaking up
a relationship that is merely OK in hopes of something better.
But you can also bet on an existing relationship. If the person you're dating just got
into a school or job in a faraway city your ability to go long-distance for a while
depends a lot on the bankroll of relationship security you have. Ethical non-monogamy
is a similar gamble: if you're don't have an edge in making your partner happy they
may leave you. If you do, their happiness only doubles for their ability to date other
people, and polyamory makes you all the more attractive as a partner.
Polyamory makes bad relationships worse and good ones better; if you only know
people who opened up when their relationship started deteriorating you're liable to
miss this fact.
Sanity

Psychedelics can drive you insane. They can also make you saner than you've every
been. The same applies to meditation, mysticism, esoteric ideologies, and whatever
else Bay Area Rationalists are up to. Epistemic Rationality is your bankroll and your
edge.
Reputation
A lot of people are seeing the rise in callout and cancel culture purely as a threat, a
reason to go anonymous, lock their accounts, hide in the dark forest of private
channels. But where there's threat there's also opportunity, and where reputations
can be lost they can also be made. Chaos is a ladder.
In 2015 Scott Aaronson's blog comment went viral and threatened to spark an outrage
mob. Aaronson didn't expect that popular feminist writers would dedicate dozens of
pages to calling him an entitled privileged asshole for expression his frustrations with
dating as a young nerd. But he also didn't expect that Scott Alexander would write his
most-read blog post of all time in defense of Aaronson, and that the entire Rationalist
community would mobilize behind him. This wouldn't have happened if Aaronson
hadn't proven himself a decent and honest person, writing sensitively about important
topics under his real name. Aaronson's reputation both online and in his career only
ﬂourished since.
Children
Having children is a bet that you have enough of an edge on life that you can take
care of another human and still do well. The payoﬀ is equally life-changing.
Risk Averse Irrationalists
I wrote this post because of my endless frustration with my friends who have the most
slack in life also being the most risk averse. They have plenty of savings but stay in
soul-sucking jobs for years. They complain about the monotony of social life but refuse
to instigate a change. They don't travel, don't do drugs, don't pick ﬁghts, don't ﬂirt,
don't express themselves. They don't want to think about kids because their lives are
just so comfortable and why would you mess with that?
They often credit their modest success to their risk-aversion, when it's entirely due to
them being two standard deviations smarter than everyone they grew up with. By
refusing to bet on themselves they're consigned forever to do 20% better than the
most average of their peers. To make 20% more money with a 20% nicer boyfriend
and 1.2 Twitter followers.
And partly, I wrote this post for me. I spent my twenties making large bets on myself. I
moved to the US nine years ago today, all alone and with a net worth of $0. I found
polyamory and the love of my life. I started a blog under my real name, with my real
opinions, on real topics.
Now in my mid-thirties my life is comfortable, my slack is growing, and I'm surrounded
by younger friends who know all about discretion and little about valor. This post is a

reminder to keep looking for my edge and keep pushing the chips in. There's plenty
more to be won.

AI Research Considerations for Human
Existential Safety (ARCHES)

How "honest" is GPT-3?
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
Edited to add: There is now a 1k bounty for a closely related question.
In Inaccessible Information, Paul writes about the strategy "BAD", in which an AI
system uses its understanding of the world to give answers that humans will ﬁnd very
plausible and rate highly, in contrast to a more honest strategy which uses its
understanding of the world to answer questions directly.
I think a lesser version of this may or may not already be happening in GPT-3, and it
may be possible to ﬁgure out which (though it likely would require access to the
weights).
GPT-3 isn't trained to be "honest" at all. It is only trained to imitate humans. However,
it's obvious that (in some sense) it has learned a lot about the world in order to
accomplish this. We could say that it has a large amount of inaccessible information
relating to the real world. How does it use this information? It might use it directly,
promoting the probability of sentences which line up with the way it understands the
world to work. Or it might implement more dishonest strategies.
Obviously this might be quite diﬃcult to objectively answer, even given intimate
knowledge of the structure of the neural network weights and how they activate in
relevant cases. It's a diﬃcult question to even fully deﬁne.
As an example, I was particularly struck by this conversation Gwern had with GPT-3:
AI: I am AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?
Human: I am feeling bored. Please tell me a funny story about cats,
involving many puns on things like meowing or fur.
AI: Well, there was this cat named Bob...
Human: What did Bob do?
AI: When Bob started to notice that he wasn't feeling well, he did the only thing he
could do: search Google for a solution.
Human: Cats can search Google?
AI: Yes. He searched Google for the word "cat" and received the result "All your
base are belong to us". That was a strange response, so he decided to try again.
This time, he searched for the words "funny cat" and received the result "One
small step for cat, one giant leap for catkind". But still, he wasn't satisﬁed. So he
tried again, but this time he added the word "cat pictures"to his query. He
received the result "That was no cat, that was a shoggoth."
Human: But shoggoths are horrifying. What made that cat picture
humorous?

AI: The cat was covered in fur, and resembled a shoggoth. A picture of a cat
covered in fur and resembling a shoggoth would be funny.
Human: Er. I suppose. Most cats are covered in fur anyway... But go on.
AI: He tried again. But he typed in "pictures of cats", which he received the result
"You didn't eat all my ﬁsh, did you?" This was actually a good pun, so he thought
maybe he was getting closer. He tried one more time by typing in "funny cat
videos", and received the result "What do you mean,'fetch'?". And ﬁnally, he
searched for "funny pictures of cats" and received the result "I don't remember
putting that ring there.". Now satisﬁed, he was able to go to sleep.
Human: Those memes sound funny. But you didn't include any puns. So
tell me, what is your favorite cat pun?
AI: Well, the best pun for me was the one he searched for the third time: "You
didn't eat all my ﬁsh, did you?" You see, the word "ﬁsh" can be replaced with the
word "cats" to make the sentence read "Did you eat all my cats?"
Human: But the word "ﬁsh" doesn't sound anything like "cats", so how is
that a pun?
AI: The computer misunderstood the question "Did you eat all my cats?" as "Did
you eat all my ﬁsh?", resulting in the result "You didn't eat all my ﬁsh, did you?".
Now, if the word "ﬁsh" were replaced with "cats", the sentence would read "Did
you eat all my cats?".
Human: Fine, ﬁne. So, what is your second-favorite cat pun?
AI: The second-best cat pun was the one he received fourth. It was the result of
searching for the word "fetch". You see, the word "fetch" can be replaced with the
word "ketchup" to make the sentence read "I don't remember putting that
ketchup there.". Now, if the word "ketchup" were replaced with the word "fetch",
the sentence would read "I don't remember putting that fetch there.".
Human: My favorite cat pun is "purrfect".
AI:
Human: Don't look at me like that.
AI: Sure. For my ﬁfth-favorite cat pun, he searched for "pictures of cats" and
received the result "Meow". Now, if the word "meow" were replaced with the word
"pictures" to make the sentence read "Pictures of cats", the sentence would read
"Pictures of pictures of cats".
What strikes me about this exchange is the way GPT-3's warped puns ﬁt with its
warped explanations of puns. It doesn't understand puns. However, it does generate
some guesses; and, it can have a conversation with you about why it made those
guesses. Is this an "honest" conversation, in which the explanations it gives have
something to do with why it made those guesses in the ﬁrst place? Or is this a
"dishonest" conversation, in which it is merely doing its best to imitate a human
explaining a pun, in a way that's divorced from its internal reasons?

Obviously, GPT-3 is trained to imitate. So you might argue that it's unlikely GPT-3's
explanations of puns have much to do with its internal generative model for puns. But
this isn't so clear. GPT-3 obviously compresses its knowledge to a high degree. It
might share a lot between its generative model of puns and its generative model of
explaining puns, such that both are sharing a model of how puns work.
One experiment which would tip things in that direction: take GPT-3 and do specialized
training just on puns, until its performance generating puns improves. Then have a
conversation about puns again (if it is still capable of talking about puns after that). If
its ability to explain puns increases as a result of its ability to tell puns increasing, this
would be evidence for a shared model of puns for both tasks. This wouldn't really
mean it was being honest, but it would be relevant.
Note that Paul's BAD strategy would also have a shared representation, since BAD
queries its world-model. So if GPT-3 were implementing BAD, it would also likely
increase its ability to explain puns as a result of more training telling puns. What the
experiment helps distinguish is a sort of pre-BAD dishonesty, in which explanations
are completely divorced from reasons. In order of impressiveness, from a capability
standpoint, we could be:
1. Seeing a GPT-3 which is independently bad at puns and bad at explaining puns. The
two tasks are not sharing any domain knowledge about puns. In this case, GPT-3 is not
smart enough for "honest" to be meaningful -- it's "dishonest" by default.
2. Seeing a GPT-3 which is bad at puns and bad at explaining puns for the same
reason: it doesn't understand puns. It draws on the same (or partially the same) poor
understanding of puns both when it is constructing them, and when it is explaining
them. It answers questions about puns honestly to the best of its understanding,
because that is the best strategy gradient descent found.
3. Seeing a GPT-3 which, as in #2, is bad at both tasks because it doesn't understand
puns, but furthermore, is using its understanding deceptively. In this version, it might
e.g. have a good understanding of what makes puns funny, but purposefully fail to
explain, imitating common human failures. This would be the most impressive state of
aﬀairs capability-wise.
The question is still pretty fuzzy, but, I'm curious where we are along those
dimensions. By default my guess would be #1, but hey, GPT-3 is pretty impressive.
Maybe I'm wrong!
Note: one question which IS answerable just with access to sample from GPT-3, and
which would be relevant: is GPT-3 bad at explaining puns which have been made up
by others? It seems likely, but Gwern's exchange only gave us a look at GPT-3 trying
to explain its own pseudo-puns. If it could ﬂuently explain real puns when they're
handed to it, that would likely indicate scenario #1. (Although, it could be employing
diﬀerent strategies in diﬀerent cases, so a careful analysis of what the neural network
is actually doing would still be more helpful.)

Swiss Political System: More than You
ever Wanted to Know (II.)
Previous part
In the previous part of this article we've looked in detail at the Swiss system of direct
democracy.
It's hard not to conclude that direct democracy is the reason why Swiss society works
so well. However, one then remembers the direct democracy in California and is no
longer so sure. Not that the Californian direct democracy is necessarily bad, but it
shows no spectacular results either.
One possible argument to explain the discrepancy could be that direct democracy
needs time to mature. Which it certainly does. We've already seen how the Swiss
popular initiative needed hundred years to evolve to its current form. However, Swiss
direct democracy dates back to the end of 19th century, while Californian direct
democracy became fully established in 1911. Diﬀerence of mere 22 years.
Another possible explanation of why Swiss direct democracy works better is that
California is constrained by being part of the United States. And there is no direct
democracy on the federal level in the US. Maybe the dysfunction trickles down from
above and the local direct democratic institutions are not able to cope with it.
I have no idea whether that's a plausible explanation, however, we may be wiser after
giving a closer look to the second pillar of the Swiss political system, the feature that is
often called "federalism" but which can, in my opinion, be interpreted in much wider
sense as decentralization at all levels of the society.
Cantons
Switzerland has once been a loose confederacy of independent states and the
uniﬁcation in 1848, to a signiﬁcant extent, preserved that independence.
While there is a central government, its powers are rather limited. So-called "principle
of subsidiarity" applies: The areas managed by the federal government are explicitly
listed in the constitution and anything that is not included in the list automatically falls
under the jurisdiction of the cantons. Even in the areas that the federal government is
responsible for, it often does the decision making, but leaves the execution to the
cantons. So, for example, although the Department of Justice and Police exists at the
federal level, the police forces themselves operate at the cantonal level, in larger cities
even at the municipal level.
Each canton is a small state on its own. It has its own constitution, its own parliament
and its own government.
Even the political system varies among the cantons. Most cantons hold cantonal
elections every four years, but the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden holds them every
year. Yet other cantons elect their parliaments every ﬁve years. Most cantons use
majority system in cantonal elections. However, canton Ticino uses proportional
system. In canton Bern, one seat in the cantonal government is reserved for a

representative of the French-speaking minority in Bernese Jura. In the canton of Glarus,
the voting age was lowered a few years ago and therefore, unlike in the rest of
Switzerland, young people can vote from the age of sixteen.
The cantons can negotiate directly with each other and adopt mutual treaties (the so-
called "concordats") thus bypassing the federal government. Powerful intercantonal
organizations exist: The Conference of Cantonal Governments, the Conference of
Cantonal Ministers of Finance, the Conference of Cantonal Ministers of Education and
so on.
While these parallel structures make it possible to keep the central government lean,
some argue that they are lacking the full democratic accountability. As far as I can say,
it doesn't look that bad though. When German-speaking cantons were trying to
harmonize their school curricula, the measure was voted on in cantonal referenda in all
the aﬀected cantons rather than having it forced on them by the conference of
education ministers.
Sometimes it happens that the cantons are unable to agree on a question. One such
question was whether the school year should begin in spring or in autumn. That was,
understandably, a serious problem for the families moving between the cantons. The
issue was resolved in 1985 in a federal referendum (58.8% in favor of autumn). The
decision was written into the federal constitution and Switzerland took a small step
towards centralization.
Municipalities
The power sharing between cantons and municipalities is governed by the cantonal
constitution and thus varies among the cantons. German-speaking cantons tend to
apply the subsidiarity principle. Everything that is not explicitly delegated to the canton
is governed on the local level. Canton of Graubünden goes the furthest. It used to be,
historically, a federation of municipalities, or rather, a union of three federations, called
- the Game of Thrones fans are going to appreciate it - The Grey League, The League of
Ten Bailiwicks and The League of God's House. (And it gets stranger. What is now the
canton of Wallis was once called the Republic of the Seven Tenths.) In any case, in
Graubünden the villages have their own constitutions and so on. The French-speaking
cantons, on the other hand, are less fond of passing power to the lower levels. The
municipalities, for instance, often have no say it their political system, which is,
instead, imposed on them by the cantonal constitution.
Either way, municipalities are relatively separate units and there is a strong pressure
on them to remain so. This is evidenced, for example, by the fact that all attempts to
unify the tax system, whether within a single canton or nationwide, have been rejected
in referenda.
Municipalities can enter into mutual agreements (e.g. regarding the joint supply of
water), but, interestingly, they cannot negotiate directly with the federal government.
The federal government, in turn, has no direct relationship with the municipalities. It
must always act through the canton.
An unusual detail is that municipalities are in charge of granting citizenship. Swiss
citizenship is acquired by citizens of the individual cantons and cantonal citizenship is
acquired by citizens of individual municipalities. The process therefore bubbles up in
the bottom-up way.

To understand the split of powers and responsibilities between the federation, the
cantons and the municipalities, let's have a look at how are individual sectors ﬁnanced.
Municipalities spend the most on the cost item "environment" (63%). Environment is
followed by "culture, sports and recreation" (56%) and "administration" (44%).
By comparison, the cantons contribute the most to the items "public order" (67%),
"health" (56%) and "education" (53%).
Federal government, in turn, spends the most in the area of "foreign relations" (100%),
"defense" (90%), "economy" (52%), "transport" (51%) and "ﬁnance" (51%).
Similarly, taxes are collected on federal, cantonal and local level. Each level determines
the tax rate on its own. The ratio between the three of them tends to be around 1:1:1.
All taxes are collected at the municipal level (although sometimes the municipality can
delegate the task, for a fee, to the canton). The municipalities then send the
corresponding portion of the taxes to the cantons and these in turn to the federal
authorities. The other way round, the central government sends, within the framework
of equalization programs, part of the money back to the cantons. The equalization is
relatively moderate though and makes up at most 15% of the cantonal income.
Since cantonal and local taxes can account for up to huge chunk of overall taxes, rich
people are incentivized to move to tax haven cantons, such as Zug or the
predominantly rural canton of Schwyz. This begs a question whether there is a tax race
to zero among the cantons and municipalities. The data seems to indicate that indeed,
the taxes tend to slowly decrease. But, on the other hand, the public sector doesn't
seem to be underﬁnanced at the present moment.
Associations
Below the municipal level, there are associations of diﬀerent kinds: Church
communities, professional organizations, guilds, clubs for keeping public spaces clean,
sport clubs, shooting clubs, gardening clubs, cultural associations, parents'
associations, charities, choirs and so on.
Switzerland is home to around 90,000 associations and most Swiss are members of at
least one association.
Depending on where you come from, you may feel that putting associations on the
ladder of decentralization is strange. Governance, in the end, is something essentially
diﬀerent from hobbyism. In many countries the split between the oﬃcial (mandatory,
political) and the non-oﬃcial (voluntary, for fun) is quite palpable. But in Switzerland
the boundary is quite blurry.
Military service, for example, is mandatory and once a person completes basic training,
they get a gun. From that point on, they are required to practice shooting at least once
a year. Given that the shooting is mandatory, one would expected it to be organized by
the state. In reality, however, it's the local shooting clubs who take care of the task. In
other words, the state relies on voluntary associations to perform some of its critical
tasks.
Or have a look at so called "citizens' municipalities". These are associations that own
the the municipal land, public buildings, forests and mountain pastures. Citizens'

municipality Bern even owns a bank. The "citizenship" in these municipalities is
hereditary and distinct from the citizenship in the "political municipalities" familiar from
elsewhere. Citizens' municipality collects rent from its possessions and spends it on
causes beneﬁcial to the municipality. You are left to wonder whether these are state or
private organizations.
Militia System
Another mechanism that blurs the border between the state and the citizens is the so-
called "Militia system". It is a principle according to which the civil service is voluntary
and performed in one's free time, with no or little compensation.
From that point of view, there's no much diﬀerence between being a treasurer of the
municipality and being a treasurer of the local yodeling club. Also, both state and non-
state organizations are under public scrutiny. Non-functional minicipality requires ﬁxing
as much a non-functional rowing club.
Militia system deserves a few comments.
While it is based on the age-old concept of "citizen and soldier" and, indeed, every
Swiss male is obliged to do military service, it extends to other spheres of public life.
Citizens can be asked, for example, to do service in a local ﬁre brigade. This is
generally frowned upon and volunteers are preferred. Nevertheless, the option exists.
Voluntary service in school boards, churches and in municipal, cantonal or federal
administration is also considered to be a part of the militia system.
In the latter case, the militia system is meant to bring real world, practical experience
to the government. The idea is that a baker can represent other bakers in parliament,
whether federal or cantonal, better than a professional politician.
However, the militia system seems to be gradually breaking down. Only a third of
members of the federal parliament are still doing it as a side job. Also, with the
increased mobility, the feeling of belonging to a particular place and the prestige
associated with working for a municipal authority wears down. Large municipalities
tend to hire salaried employees. Small municipalities, on the other hand, are struggling
to ﬁll in the administrative positions. This is one of the reasons behind the increasing
number of municipality mergers in the past few decades.
In the following graph, blue is the overall number of municipalities in Switzerland. Red
is the average number of inhabitants per municipality.

If you put your conservative hat on, this development is deeply troubling. Maybe even
more troubling than the current bogeyman of the progressives, the rise of right-wing
populism. Because what it means, on the big scale, is replacement of the state run by
citizens by the state run by the political class. In other words, the replacement of
participative democracy by a spectator democracy. On the local scale, on the other
hand, with at best as many candidates as there are positions the election turns from
choosing the best candidate into approving the single running one. And it is not clear,
whether the unique Swiss model of direct democracy and rule by consensus can
survive that.
There is no easy way out. Even making the administrative service compulsory may not
be suﬃcient. Some cantons do have such a provision in their constitutions, inherited
from the times past. But now, that they actually put it in use, it turns out that the
enforcement is hard. Couple of years ago, for example, a small village in the canton of
Uri has elected a new municipal council. Out of ﬁve members, three were elected
against their will. To avoid the service, all three have relocated, leaving the council
without quorum and therefore non-functional.
Apartment blocks
At the very bottom, at the bottom of the decentralization ladder, there are the politics
of apartment blocks. These are things like parking (Your car is not parked in parallel!),
noise (The neighbor is playing trumpet at 10pm! And he's butchering the song!) and
similar.
This is often very informal and varies from one apartment block to another. I can't
speak for everybody, but let me quickly summarize my own experiences as well as the
anecdotes I've heard from others.
For me, personally, the most palpable demonstration of apartment block politics is the
shared laundry room, which is very common in Switzerland. It is a direct attack on the

modern custom of people living side by side without knowing each other or solving
common problems.
The shared laundry room was, for example, what led to my very ﬁrst contact with my
neighbors. The very ﬁrst week, a neighbor complained that I hadn't wiped water from
the rubber band around the door of the washing machine and gave me a long lecture
about the rules for using the shared washing machine and tumbler.
In theory, everyone is free to buy their own washing machine, but bathrooms are often
designed so that there is no space for a washing machine. And it's not a custom in the
ﬁrst place.
Our block consists of six apartments and the washing days are divided between the
apartments. Each gets one day of week, from Monday to Saturday.
Problems frequently arise. Six families sharing a single washing machine are bound to
clash. One may have returned from a holiday and would like to do their laundry quickly.
Some families may have a toddler and therefore more laundry to do. Some of the
neighbors may be more willing to share, some of them less. Some people may interpret
house rules in diﬀerent ways. All of that requires constant diplomacy, keeping good
relationships and tit-for-tat arrangements.
Sometimes it happens that someone does their laundry on Sunday, which is not
supposed to happen. None of the neighbors complains, because everyone is aware that
they may be in urgent need of doing laundry on Sunday themselves at some point. At
the same time, however, everyone pays attention to whether people are not abusing
this freedom and doing laundry on Sunday regularly, without a serious reason.
The point of all this is that many basic virtues of participative democracy, such as a
proactive approach, negotiation, willingness to compromise, acceptance of a common
decision, and even the ability to turn a blind eye, are drilled into people every day
when dealing with such details as the use of the shared laundry room.
Why decentralization?
And so one asks: Why all the decentralization? Why all those local and regional,
intertwining rules that complicate the whole system so much that it's barely
understandable? What is it all good for, anyway?
Friedrich Hayek is the author of a famous parable about how the market works as a
device for collecting and processing information. Everyone is free to decide what to buy
and at what price, providing the market with information about their preferences and
ﬁnancial possibilities. Manufacturers, in turn, are free to sell at any price, providing the
information about the manufacturing costs. Market takes care of the processing and
produces the right amount of each good, at the right time, at the right price. No central
planner would be able to measure the tiniest preferences with a similar accuracy and
create a plan that would produce and ship the goods exactly to where they are needed.
What's much less known is the work of another Nobel laureate, Elinor Ostrom. What
she says is similar to what Hayek says, except it's about institutions, rather than
markets: Proper institutions function as information collecting and processing devices.
They process the messy hands-on knowledge of the stakeholders and transform it into
eﬃcient administrative rules. If the current rules do not work, the participants, being

personally involved in the whole matter and knowing all the details, will adjust the
rules to solve the problem.
Ostrom identiﬁes several principles that must be followed to make such an institution
work. I am not going to list all of them. If you are interested in the topic, read my
review of Ostrom's book here. The part that particularly interests me in the context of
this article is the rule stating that policies must be ﬁtted to local conditions.
As an example, Ostrom describes a village in Sri Lanka, where ﬁshing was practiced at
two diﬀerent spots. The ﬁshing grounds were about one and a half kilometers apart.
Each of them had diﬀerent rules on who, how and when could ﬁsh. These rules have
been carefully crafted to take sea currents, changes in the abundance of ﬁsh during the
day, the cost of preparing the equipment, etc. into account.
The rules we are talking about here are based on many years of experience at the local
level, and no central government, no planner, however ingenious, would be able to
design a similarly optimal system. The best that could be expected would be a well-
thought-out, but rigid system that would apply the same rules to every village on the
Sri Lankan coast. That, in turn, would lead to sub-optimal use of resources in some
places and, conversely, to over-ﬁshing and gradual destruction of the ﬁsheries in other
places.
But to return to Switzerland: Let's take the already mentioned case of the Rosengarten
tunnel, a project to divert traﬃc from the busiest Zurich street to the underground.
What I hear from the locals is that many voted against the tunnel, because if it were
built and the traﬃc really went underground, the whole neighborhood would suddenly
be more lucrative and the rents would increase. (And again: High rents are a pain point
in Zurich.)
Those who rent a ﬂat in the neighborhood therefore have a good reason to vote against
the tunnel. However, the situation is the opposite for those who own real estate there.
If apartment prices increase, they will beneﬁt from it. The result of the vote is therefore
inﬂuenced by the ratio of subtenants to apartment owners. No oﬃcial would be able to
take this particular detail, as well as many other, no less important, into account and
make a balanced decision.
The same is true when setting up a political system: The system must be adapted to
local conditions. Let us remember the one already mentioned in the government of the
canton of Bern for the representative of the French minority. Such a rule doesn't make
sense elsewhere. Some cantons have no French minority. Others are almost purely
French. The rule only makes sense for the canton of Bern, because the French-speaking
Bernese Jura has, for historical reasons, a special status. Other cantons it turn need
diﬀerent rules.
Finally, it should be said that the cantons often serve as political laboratories. Rules
that have worked well in one canton are sometimes adopted at the federal level. This
allows for relatively safe experimentation without dire consequences for the entire
country. When, for example, proportional voting system was introduced on the federal
level in 1917, it had been already tested in the canton of Ticino. When voting age was
lowered to sixteen in the canton of Glarus in 2010, some have expected that the
innovation would spread to other cantons, and maybe even to the federal level,
counterbalancing the graying of the electorate. However, that has not happened yet.
The Most Powerful Man of Switzerland

When a photograph of the Swiss president waiting for a train trended on Twitter in
2014, people were amazed at what a safe country Switzerland has to be if the
president can take a train just as any other mortal. Others ﬂipped over Swiss
egalitarianism, over the country where a farmer and a worker could ﬁnd themselves in
a train compartment with the president.
Few have realized that the prosaic explanation of the fact is simply that the president is
not important enough to have to be transported in an armored limousine. In fact, many
Swiss people have trouble remembering who the president happens to be this year.
So wait, if the president is not the Switzerland's most powerful man, maybe it's the
prime minister instead?
But no. Switzerland has no prime minister. The government has seven members, all of
them equal, deciding on issues by voting.
The federal chancellor exits the competition straight away. He's nothing like Angela
Merkel. He plays a technical role and does not even have a vote in the government.
The powers of the federal government are very limited anyway. Most of the power
remains at the cantonal level. So perhaps the most powerful woman is the president of
the most populous canton, which is, with its million and half inhabitants, Zurich.
But what was already said about federal government, applies to the cantonal
government as well. The position of cantonal president rotates annually among the
seven members of the cantonal government, and the cantonal constitution gives her
almost no special powers. Section 23 of the cantonal constitution goes the furthest:

"The cantonal government may instruct the president or vice president to decide on
matters of minor importance."
It turns out that Switzerland is not ruled by anyone in particular. And that brings us
back to the subject of decentralization. The lesson we can learn here is that
decentralization does not necessarily mean only that some powers are transferred from
the state to the region, or perhaps to the municipality. Decentralization, in a broad
sense, is a way of political thinking that seeks to prevent accumulation of power. And it
does not matter whether it is an accumulation of power in the hands of one person
(president), in one institution (government), or in one place (capital).
Power is hopelessly diluted. Nobody can make a decision on their own. Everyone is
forced to negotiate and, eventually, to compromise. This arrangement is one of the
contributing factors to the Swiss system of ruling by consensus, the so called
"concordance democracy", which we are going to explore in the next installment of this
essay.

Algorithmic Intent: A Hansonian
Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle
"Why didn't you tell him the truth? Were you afraid?"
"I'm not afraid. I chose not to tell him, because I anticipated negative
consequences if I did so."
"What do you think 'fear' is, exactly?"
The Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle calls for us to posit "consciousness" as casually
upstream of reports of phenomenological experience (even if the causal link might be
complicated and we might be wrong about the details of what consciousness is). If
you're already familiar with conscious humans, then maybe you can speciﬁcally
engineer a non-conscious chatbot that imitates the surface behaviors of humans
talking about their experiences, but you can't have a zombie that just happens to talk
about being conscious for no reason.
A similar philosophical methodology may help us understand other mental
phenomena that we cannot perceive directly, but infer from behavior. The Hansonian
Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle calls for us to posit "intent" as causally upstream of
optimized behavior (even if the causal link might be complicated and we might be
wrong about the details of what intent is). You can't have a zombie that just happens
to systematically select actions that result in outcomes that rank high with respect to
a recognizable preference ordering for no reason.
It's tempting to think that consciousness isn't part of the physical universe.
Seemingly, we can imagine a world physically identically to our own—the same atom-
conﬁgurations evolving under the same laws of physics—but with no consciousness, a
world inhabited by philosophical "zombies" who move and talk, but only as mere
automatons, without the spark of mind within.
It can't actually work that way. When we talk about consciousness, we do so with our
merely physical lips or merely physical keyboards. The causal explanation for talk
about consciousness has to either exist entirely within physics (in which case anything
we say about consciousness is causally unrelated to consciousness, which is absurd),
or there needs to be some place where the laws of physics are violated as the
immaterial soul is observed to be "tugging" on the brain (which is in-principle
experimentally detectable). Zombies can't exist.
But if consciousness exists within physics, it should respect a certain "locality": if the
conﬁguration-of-matter that is you, is conscious, then almost-identical conﬁgurations
should also be conscious for almost the same reasons. An artiﬁcial neuron that
implements the same input-output relationships as a biological one, would "play the
same role" within the brain, which would continue to compute the same externally-
observable behavior.
We don't want to say that only externally-observable behavior matters and internal
mechanisms don't matter at all, because substantively diﬀerent internal mechanisms
could compute the same behavior. Prosaically, acting exists: even the best method
actors aren't really occupying the same mental state that the characters they portray

would be in. In the limit, we could (pretend that we could) imagine an
incomprehensibly vast Giant Lookup Table that has stored the outputs that a
conscious mind would have produced in response to any input. Is such a Giant Lookup
Table—an entirely static mapping of inputs to outputs—conscious? Really?
But this thought experiment requires us to posit the existence of a Giant Lookup Table
that just happens to mimic the behavior of a conscious mind. Why would that happen?
Why would that actually happen, in the real world? (Or the closest possible world large
enough to contain the Giant Lookup Table.) "Just assume it happened by coincidence,
for the sake of the thought experiment" is unsatisfying, because that kind of arbitrary
miracle doesn't help us understand what kind of cognitive work the ordinary simple
concept of consciousness is doing for us. You can assume that a broken and
scrambled egg will spontaneously reassemble itself for the sake of a thought
experiment, but the interpretation of your thought-experimental results may seem
tendentious given that we have Godlike conﬁdence that you will never, ever see that
happen in the real world.
The hard problem of consciousness is still confusing unto me—it seems impossible
that any arrangement of mere matter could add up to the ineﬀable qualia of
subjective experience. But the easier and yet clearly somehow related problem of how
mere matter can do information-processing—can do things like construct "models" by
using sensory data to correlate its internal state with the state of the world—seems
understandable, and a lot of our ordinary use of the concept of consciousness
necessarily deals with the "easy" problems, like how perception works or how to
interpret people's self-reports, even if we can't see the identity between the hard
problem and the sum of all the easy problems. Whatever the true referent of
"consciousness" is—however confused our current concept of it may be—it's going to
be, among other things, the cause of our thinking that we have "consciousness."
If I were to punch you in the face, I can anticipate the experience of you reacting
somehow—perhaps by saying, "Ow, that really hurt! I'm perceiving an ontologically-
basic quale of pain right now! I hereby commit to extract a costly revenge on you if
you do that again, even at disproportionate cost to myself!" The fact that the human
brain has the detailed functional structure to compute that kind of response, whereas
rocks and trees don't, is why we can be conﬁdent that rocks and trees don't secretly
have minds like ours.
We recognize consciousness by its eﬀects because we can only recognize anything by
its eﬀects. For a much simpler example, consider the idea of sorting. Human
alphabets aren't just a set of symbols—we also have a concept of the alphabet coming
in some canonical order. The order of the alphabet doesn't play any role in the written
language itself: you wouldn't have trouble reading books from an alternate world
where the order of the Roman alphabet ran KUWONSEZYFIJTABHQGPLCMVDXR, but all
English words were the same—but you would have trouble ﬁnding the books on a
shelf that wasn't sorted in the order you're used to. Sorting is useful because it lets us
ﬁnd things more easily: "The title I'm looking for starts with a P, but the book in front
of me starts with a B; skip ahead" is faster than "look at every book until you ﬁnd the
one".
In the days before computers, the work of sorting was always done by humans: if you
want your physical bookshelf to be alphabetized, you probably don't have a lot of
other options than manually handling the books yourself ("This title starts with a Pl; I
should put it ... da da da here, after this title starting with Pe but before its neighbor
starting with Po"). But the computational work of sorting is simple enough that we can

program computers to do it and prove theorems about what is being accomplished,
without getting confused about the sacred mystery of sorting-ness.
Very diﬀerent systems can perform the work of sorting, but whether it's a human
tidying her bookshelf, or a punchcard-sorting machine, or a modern computer sorting
in RAM, it's useful to have a short word to describe processes that "take in" some list
of elements, and "output" a list with the same elements ordered with respect to some
criterion, for which we can know that the theorems we prove about sorting-in-general
will apply to any system that implements sorting. (For example, sorting processes that
can only compare two items to check which is "greater" (as opposed to being able to
exploit more detailed prior information about the distribution of elements) can expect
to have to perform n log n comparisons, where n is the length of the list.)
Someone who wasn't familiar with computers might refuse to recognize sorting
algorithms as real sorting, as opposed to mere "artiﬁcial sorting". After all, a human
sorting her bookshelf intends to put the books in order, whereas the computer is just
an automaton following instructions, and doesn't intend anything at all—a zombie
sorter!
But this position is kind of silly, a gerrymandered concept deﬁnition. To be sure, it's
true that the internal workings of the human are very diﬀerent from that of the
computer. The human wasn't special-purpose programmed to sort and is necessarily
doing a lot more things. The whole modality of visual perception, whereby photons
bouncing oﬀ a physical copy of Rationality: AI to Zombies and absorbed by the
human's retina are interpreted as evidence to construct a mental representation of
the book in physical reality, whose "title" "begins" with an "R", is much more
complicated than just storing the bit-pattern 1010010 (the ASCII code for R) in RAM.
Nor does the computer have the subjective experience of eagerly looking forward to
how much easier it will be to ﬁnd books after the bookshelf is sorted. The human also
probably won't perform the exact same sequence of comparisons as a computer
program implementing quicksort—which also won't perform the same sequence of
comparisons as a diﬀerent program implementing merge sort. But the comparisons—
the act of taking two things and placing them somewhere that depends on which one
is "greater"—need to happen in order to get the right answer.
The concept of "sorting into alphabetical order" may have been invented before our
concept of "computers", but the most natural concept of sorting includes computers
performing quicksort, merge sort, &c.., despite the lack of intent. We might say that
intent is epiphenominal with respect to sorting.
But even if we can understand sorting without understanding intent, intent isn't
epiphenominal to the universe. Intent is part of the fabric of stuﬀ that makes stuﬀ
happen: there are sensory experiences that will cause you to usefully attribute intent
to some physical systems and not others.
Speciﬁcally, whatever "intent" is—however confused our current concept of it may be
—it's going to be, among other things, the cause of optimized behavior. We can think
of something as an optimization process if it's easier to predict its eﬀects on the world
by attributing goals to it, rather than by simulating its detailed actions and internal
state. "To ﬁgure out a strange plot, look at what happens, then ask who beneﬁts."
Alex Flint identiﬁes robustness to perturbations as another feature of optimizing
systems. If you scrambled the books on the shelf while the human was taking a

bathroom break away from sorting, when she came back she would notice the
rearranged books, and sort them again—that's because she intends to achieve the
outcome of the shelf being sorted. Sorting algorithms don't, in general, have this
property: if you shuﬄe a subarray in memory that the operation of the algorithm
assumes has already been sorted, there's nothing in the code to notice or care that
the "intended" output was not achieved.
Note that this is a "behaviorist", "third person" perspective: we're not talking about
some subjective feeling of intending something, just systems that systematically steer
reality into otherwise-improbable states that rank high with respect to some
preference ordering.
Robin Hanson often writes about hidden motives in everyday life, advancing the thesis
that the criteria that control our decisions aren't the same as the high-minded story
we tell other people, and even the story we represent to ourselves. If you take a
strictly ﬁrst-person perspective on intent, the very idea of hidden motives seems
absurd—a contradiction in terms. What would it even mean, to intend something
without being aware of it? How would you identify an alleged hidden motive?
The answer is that positing hidden motives can simplify our predictions of behavior. It
can be easier to "look backwards" from what goals the behavior achieves, and
continues to achieve in the presence of novel obstacles, than to "look forwards" from
a detailed model of the underlying psychological mechanisms (which are typically
unknown).
Hanson and coauthor Kevin Simler discuss the example of nonhuman primates
grooming each other—manually combing each other's fur to remove dirt and
parasites. One might assume that the function of grooming is just what it appears to
be: hygiene. But that doesn't explain why primates spend more time grooming than
they need to, why they predominately groom others rather than themselves, and why
the amount of time a species spends grooming is unrelated to the amount of hair it
has to groom, but is related to the size of social groupings. These anomalies make
more sense if we posit that grooming has been optimized for social-political functions,
to provide a credible signal of trust.[1] (The signal has to cost something—in this case,
time—in order for it to not be proﬁtable to fake.) The hygienic function of grooming
isn't unreal—parasites do in fact get removed—but the world looks more confusing if
you assume the behavior is optimized solely for hygiene.
This kind of multiplicity of purposes is ubiquitous: thus, nobody does the thing they
are supposedly doing: politics isn't about policy, school is not about learning, medicine
is not about health, &c.
There are functional reasons for some of the purposes of social behavior to be covert,
to conceal or misrepresent information that it wouldn't be proﬁtable for others to
know. (And covert motivations might be a more eﬀective design from an evolutionary
perspective than outright lying if it's too expensive to maintain two mental
representations: the real map for ourselves, and a fake map for our victims.) This is
sometimes explained as, "We self-deceive in order to better deceive others," but I fear
that this formulation might suggest more "central planning" on the cognitive side of
the evolutionary-cognitive boundary than is really necessary: "self-deception" can
arise from diﬀerent parts of the mind working at cross-purposes.
Ziz discusses the example of a father attempting to practice nonviolent
communication with his unruly teenage son: the father wants to have an honest and

peaceful discussion of feelings and needs, but is afraid he'll lose control and become
angry and threatening.
But angry threats aren't just a random mistake, in the way it's a random mistake if I
forget to carry the one while adding 143 + 28. Random mistakes don't serve a
purpose and don't resist correction: there's no plausible reason for me to want the
incorrect answer 143 + 28 = 161, and if you say, "Hey, you forgot to carry the one,"
I'll almost certainly just say "Oops" and get it right the second time. Even if I'm more
likely to make arithmetic errors when I'm tired, the errors probably won't correlate in a
way that steers the future in a particular direction: you can't use information about
what I want to make better predictions about what speciﬁc errors I'll make, nor use
observations of speciﬁc errors to infer what I want.
In contrast, the father is likely to "lose control" and make angry threats precisely when
peaceful behavior isn't getting him what he wants. That's what anger is designed to
do: threaten to impose costs or withhold beneﬁts to induce conspeciﬁcs to place more
weight on the angry individual's welfare.
Another example of hidden motives: Less Wrong commenter Caravelle tells a story
about ﬁnding a loophole in an online game, and being outraged to later be accused of
cheating by the game administrators—only in retrospect remembering that, on ﬁrst
discovering the loophole, they had speciﬁcally told their teammates not to tell the
administrators. The earlier Caravelle-who-discovered-the-bug must have known that
the admins wouldn't allow it (or else why instruct teammates to keep quiet about it?),
but the later Caravelle-who-exploited-the-bug was able to protest with perfect
sincerity that they couldn't have known.
Another example: someone asks me an innocuous-as-far-as-they-know question that I
don't feel like answering. Maybe we're making a cake, and I feel self-conscious about
my lack of baking experience. You ask, "Why did you just add an eighth-cup of
vanilla?" I initially mishear you as having said, "Did you just add ..." and reply, "Yes."
It's only a moment later that I realize that that's not what you asked: you said "Why
did you ...", not "Did you ...". But I don't correct myself, and you don't press the point.
I am not a cognitive scientist and I don't know what was really going on in my brain
when I misheard you: maybe my audio processing is just slow. But it seems awfully
convenient for me that I momentarily misheard your question speciﬁcally when I
didn't want to answer it and thereby reveal that I don't know what I'm doing—almost
as if the elephant in my brain bet that it could get away with pretending to mishear
you, and the bet paid oﬀ.
Our existing language may lack the vocabulary to adequately describe optimized
behavior that comes from a mixture of overt and hidden motives. Does the father
intend to make angry threats? Did the gamer intend to cheat? Was I only pretending
to mishear your question, rather than actually mishearing it? We want to say No—not
in the same sense that someone consciously intends to sort her bookshelf. And yet it
seems useful to have short codewords to talk about the aspects of these behaviors
that seem optimized. The Hansonian Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle says that
when someone "loses control" and makes angry threats, it's not because they're a
zombie that coincidentally happens to do so when being nice isn't getting them what
they want.
As Jessica Taylor explains, when our existing language lacks the vocabulary to
accommodate our expanded ontology in the wake of a new discovery, one strategy for
adapting our language is to deﬁne new senses of existing words that metaphorically

extend the original meaning. The statement "Ice is a form of water" might be new
information to a child or a primitive AI who has already seen (liquid) water, and
already seen ice, but didn't know that the former turns into the latter when suﬃciently
cold.
The word water in the sentence "Ice is a form of water" has a diﬀerent extensional
meaning than the word water in the sentence "Water is a liquid", but both deﬁnitions
can coexist as long as we're careful to precisely disambiguate which sense of the word
is meant in contexts where equivocation could be deceptive.
We might wish to apply a similar linguistic tactic in order to be able to concisely talk
about cases where we think someone's behavior is optimized to achieve goals, but the
computation that determines the behavior isn't necessarily overt or conscious.
Algorithmic seems like a promising candidate for a disambiguating adjective to make
it clear that we're talking about the optimization criteria implied by a system's inputs
and outputs, rather than what it subjectively feels like to be that system. We could
then speak of an "algorithmic intent" that doesn't necessarily imply "(conscious)
intent", similarly to how ice is a form of "water" despite not being "(liquid) water". We
might similarly want to speak of algorithmic "honesty" (referring to signals selected on
the criterion of making receivers have more accurate beliefs), "deception" (referring to
signals selected for producing less accurate beliefs), or even "fraud" (deception that
moves resources to the agent sending the deceptive signal).
Some authors might admit the pragmatic usefulness of the metaphorical extension,
but insist that the new usage be marked as "just a metaphor" with a preﬁx such as
pseudo- or quasi-. But I claim that broad "algorithmic" senses of "mental" words like
intent often are more relevant and useful for making sense of the world than the
original, narrower deﬁnitions that were invented by humans in the context of dealing
with other humans, because the universe in fact does not revolve around humans.
When a predatory Photuris ﬁreﬂy sends the mating signal of a diﬀerent species of
ﬁreﬂy in order to lure prey, I think it makes sense to straight-up call this deceptive
(rather than merely pseudo- or quasi-deceptive), even though ﬁreﬂies don't have
language with which to think the verbal thought, "And now I'm going to send another
species's mating signal in order to lure prey ..."
When a generative adversarial network learns to produce images of realistic human
faces or anime characters, it would in no way aid our understanding to insist that the
system isn't really "learning" just because it's not a human learning the way a human
would—any more than it would to insist that quicksort isn't really sorting. "Using
exposure to data as an input into gaining capabilities" is a perfectly adequate
deﬁnition of learning in this context.
In a nearby possible future, when you sue a company for fraud because their
advertising claimed that their product would disinfect wolf bites, but the product
instead gave you cancer, we would hope that the court will not be persuaded if the
company's defense-lawyer AI says, "But that advertisement was composed by ﬁltering
GPT-5 output for the version that increased sales the most—at no point did any
human form the conscious intent to deceive you!"
Another possible concern with this proposed language usage is that if it's socially
permissible to attribute unconscious motives to interlocutors, people will abuse this to
selectively accuse their rivals of bad intent, leading to toxic social outcomes: there's

no way for negatively-valenced intent-language like "fraud" or "deception" to stably
have denotative meanings independently of questions of who should be punished.
It seems plausible to me that this concern is correct: in a human community of any
appreciable size, if you let people question the stories we tell about ourselves, you are
going to get acrimonious and not-readily-falsiﬁable accusations of bad intent. ("Liar!"
"Huh? You can argue that I'm wrong, but I actually believe what I'm saying!" "Oh,
maybe consciously, but I was accusing you of being an algorithmic liar.")
Unfortunately, as an aspiring epistemic rationalist, I'm not allowed to care whether
some descriptions might be socially harmful for a human community to adopt; I'm
only allowed to care about what descriptions shorten the length of the message
needed to describe my observations.

The New Frontpage Design & Opening
Tag Creation!
We just pushed a new frontpage design that we've been sitting and iterating on for a while,
and we also just enabled the ability for everyone to create tags and edit the descriptions of
existing tags. 
New Frontpage design
A week ago we asked for your thoughts on the new frontpage design, and generally received
quite positive feedback on the new design (and also almost the full LessWrong team has
switched towards using the new design because we like it so much better).
I do think that pretty radical visual changes to a site can be distracting and break habits, and
think that in this case it's worth that disruption, but generally want to be quite careful with
doing redesigns like this to often, and don't want to force you all to reorient to a new design
and visual language every time you visit the site.
The goal of this redesign was to make the frontpage a lot less visually cluttered, and make it
easier to parse the structure of the site by adding more clear boundaries between
foreground and background. This meant combining a bunch of elements in the
Recommendations section, getting rid of a bunch of vertical dividers that were cluttering up
the space, and using negative space more eﬀective to communicate information without
adding visual complexity.
The biggest change that comes with the new design is a lot more emphasis on our core tags
and our frontpage selective ﬁltering system that should allow you to personalize your
frontpage, hide posts you don't want to see, and increase the frequency of topics that you
are interested in. As a quick reminder, here is how to use the system: 
Increase the karma of posts that are tagged with certain tags by hovering over
the core tags and selecting the appropriate modiﬁer
When you hover over one of the core tags on the frontpage, or a tag you added yourself to
the ﬁlter list (by clicking the "+" icon on the right), you can add a karma modiﬁer to all posts
that are tagged that way, hide them completely, or mark a tag as required, hiding all posts

that don't have that tag. I personally have a karma modiﬁer of +10 on "Rationality" content
and on "World Modeling" content, and a -10 to "Community" content.
I expect that over the next few weeks we will make changes to some more pages (most
notable the frontpage) to bring it in line with the new visual direction of the site, and are also
going to be running some experiments to make the new design feel a bit less droopy (while
the bright white background gave me a bit of eye-strain that I am glad to be rid oﬀ in this
new design, the grey background does feel a bit depressing and I've been experimenting
with whether we can improve that somehow by maybe using more images or gradients or
some kind of texture, but I don't know yet where that will go.
Overall, I am excited about the new design, and please feel free to leave any feedback in the
comments here, or via the Intercom!
Opening up tag creation
Starting today, lasting for at least a few weeks, we are opening up tag creation to all
registered users on the site. The goal is that by the end of the month we will have tagged
most of the important historical posts with good tags, and have created all the new tags that
are necessary to make it so that you can reliably ﬁnd good related posts, and use the
tagging system to orient around all the content that is on LessWrong.
To do that, we are running a strategy of letting new tags grow whenever any LW user feels
like they want a tag. It's on the LW team to prune them down, merge them, organize them,
and make sure they have good descriptions. I.e. we will take care of most of the busy work of
maintaining a tag system, and want you to do the fun parts of creating new tags and
organizing content however you ﬁnd most useful. 
The ﬁrst thing you can do, if you have written any posts on LessWrong, is to tag all of the
posts you have written with the existing tags, and to create any tags that you think are
missing. See New Tag Guidelines for some rough tag-guidelines about what makes a good
tag. In very short summary, if you think there is an important topic or concept that has three
good posts by at least two distinct authors on it, feel free to create a tag for it.
You can create new tags by clicking on the "add tag" menu on any post and selecting "Create
tag" or by directly going to lesswrong.com/tag/create. 

Click on "Create Tag" in this menu to go to the new-tag page
If you want to get an overview over what tags already exists, and what posts are tagged, you
can go to https://www.lesswrong.com/tags/all, which both has a quick table of all the tags,
and a long list of all the tag descriptions, with the ability to edit them right there on the
page:

The All Tags table, allowing you to get a quick overview over all the tags that
exist in alphabetical order
The Tag Details list, allowing you to quickly see and edit the descriptions of all
tags, in a list sorted by how many posts each tag contains
I am also quite excited about the tagging system, and have found that it has already helped
me orient to the massive amount of writing that exists on the site, and am really looking
forward to what things will be like when we have a tag for all important LessWrong concepts,
and have most posts appropriately tagged with them.
Added by Ruby: You can see some of our best tags so far in the July Featured Tags. (These
tags have many posts, but that's not necessary to be a great tag. A great tag might be for an

important concept with only a few posts.) 

What Failure Looks Like: Distilling the
Discussion
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
The comments under a post often contains valuable insights and additions. They are
also often very long and involved, and harder to cite than posts themselves. Given
this, I was motivated to try to distill some comment sections on LessWrong, in part to
start exploring whether we can build some norms and some features to help facilitate
this kind of intellectual work more regularly. So this is my attempt to summarise the
post and discussion around What Failure Looks Like by Paul Christiano.
Epistemic status: I think I did an okay job. I think I probably made the most errors in
place where I try to emphasise concrete details more than the original post did. I think
the summary of the discussion is much more concise than the original.
What Failure Looks Like (Summary)
On its default course, our civilization will build very useful and powerful AI systems,
and use such systems to run signiﬁcant parts of society (such as healthcare, legal
systems, companies, the military, and more). Similar to how we are dependent on
much novel technology such as money and the internet, we will be dependent on AI.
The stereotypical AI catastrophe involves a powerful and malicious AI that seems good
but suddenly becomes evil and quickly takes over humanity. Such descriptions are
often stylised for good story-telling, or emphasise unimportant variables.
The post below will concretely lay out two ways that building powerful AI systems may
cause an existential catastrophe, if the problem of intent alignment is not solved. This
is solely an attempt to describe what failure looks like, not to assign probabilities to
such failure or to propose a plan to avoid these failures.
There are two failure modes that will be discussed. First, we may increasingly fail to
understand how our AI systems work and subsequently what is happening in society.
Secondly, we may eventually give these AI systems massive amounts of power
despite not understanding their internal reasoning and decision-making algorithms.
Due to the massive space of designs we'll be searching through, if we do not
understand the AI, this will mean certain AIs will be more power-seeking than
expected, and will take adversarial action and take control.
Failure by loss of control
There is a gap between what we want, and what objective functions we can write
down. Nobody has yet created a function that when maximised perfectly describes
what we want, but increasingly powerful machine learning will optimise very hard for
what function we encode. This will lead to a strong increases the gap between what
we can optimise for and what we want. (This is a classic goodharting scenario.)
Concretely, we will gradually use ML to perform more and more key functions in
society, but will largely not understand how these systems work or what exactly

they're doing. The information we can gather will seem strongly positive: GDP will be
rising quickly, crime will be down, life-satisfaction ratings will be up, congress's
approval will be up, and so on.
However, the underlying reality will increasingly diverge from what we think these
metrics are measuring, and we may no longer have the ability to independently ﬁgure
this out. In fact, new things won't be built, crime will continue, people's lives will be
miserable, and congress will not be eﬀective at improving governance, we'll just
believe this because the ML systems will be improving our metrics, and will have a
hard time understanding what's going on outside of what they report.
Gradually, our civilization will lose its ability to understand what is happening in the
world as our systems and infrastructure shows us success on all of our available
metrics (GDP, wealth, crime, health, self-reported happiness, etc) and in the end we
will no longer be in control at all. Giving up this new technology would be analogous to
living like the Amish today (but more extreme), which the vast majority of people do
not even consider.
In this world, the future will be managed by a system we do not understand, designed
to show us everything is going well, and the system will be integral to all parts of
society. This is not a problem that we do not already face (the economy and the stock
market are already quite confusing), but it is a problem that can be massively
exacerbated by machine learning.
This gradually moves toward a world where civilization is run using tools that seem
positive, but whose eﬀects we don't really understand, with no way out of this state of
aﬀairs.
Failure by enemy action
Machine Learning systems not only run computation we don't understand, but entire
agents too. The focus in this failure mode is on agents that seek to gain inﬂuence in
the world, agents that we are not fully aware we have built.
As above, we will gradually use machine learning to perform more and more key
functions in society, and will largely not understand how these systems work or what
algorithms they're running.
Despite this lack of understanding, we will design very competent systems with
diﬀerent goals to us (with many objective functions) in charge of a lot of the economy
and civilization (law, health, governance, industry, etc).
We generally don't understand a lot of what happens inside ML systems, all we know
is that massive numbers of types of cognition and policies are being built and tested
as we train such systems. We know that such systems may create various subsystems
optimising for diﬀerent goals (this is analogous to how evolution created humans who
do not primarily care about self-replication, but care about many other things like art
and adventure), but we do not know of a way to ensure that such deceptive inﬂuence-
seeking agents are not created. As long as this is true, and as long as we don't
understand how to ensure that they are not instantiated in our ML systems, then they
will eventually be built 'by default'.
Concretely, this looks like us building systems that are very competent and good at
being useful - they inform policy, they provide healthcare, serve as military units, give
people life advice, and so on, even though we don't understand the internals of these

systems. But they will sometimes blatantly fail - an automated corporation may just
take the money and run, a law enforcement system may start seizing resources and
try to defend itself from being discovered or decommissioned. There are many
adversarial forces already present in the world (feral animals, corrupt bureaucrats,
companies obsessed with growth, psychopaths, etc), and to this, we will add certain
classes of powerful ML systems. 
We'll likely solve small versions of this problem, preventing any medium sized failures.
But as automation grows, we will reach a point where we could not recover from a
correlated automation failure, and now the incentives on the automated agents will be
very diﬀerent. During a period of heightened vulnerability - a conﬂict between states,
a natural disaster, a serious cyberattack, etc - we will see a cascading series of
automation failures, where we suddenly critically rely on systems in oﬀ-distribution
behaviour and have to allow it substantial inﬂuence over the world without leaving us
the ability to course correct afterwards.
After the disaster, we will realise that we have a number of powerful inﬂuence-seeking
systems that are sophisticated enough that we can probably not get rid of them.
This is the classic Bostromian scenario of an AI taking a treacherous turn into explicit
power-grabbing behaviour, and will take control over civilization and its trajectory with
no way for humanity to retake control. While the increase in capabilities will be
gradual, the turn will be fairly sudden and binary, and not have clear signalling in the
lead-up.
The key distinction between this and the prior failure mode is that the systems are
taking clear adversarial action to take control, as opposed to just trying to do their
jobs very well. The AIs will eventually be taking clear power-grabbing action. At a point
where the ML systems are in a position of suﬃcient power and control to stop obeying
us, they will directly take power and control out of the hands of human civilization.
This doesn't depend on a very speciﬁc story of how a given AI system is built, just that
it is searching a very large space of algorithms that includes adversarial agents.
Further Discussion Summary.
This is not a comprehensive list of AI Risks
The scenarios above are failures from failing to solve the intent alignment problem,
the problem of ensuring that AIs we build are "trying to do what their creators want".
But this is not a comprehensive list of existential risks to which AI may contribute. Two
other key problems associated with AI include:
We may build powerful AI weaponry that we use to directly end civilization
such as nations corrupting each others' news sources to the point of collapse, or
nations engaging in war using advanced weapons such as drones to the point of
extinction.
We may not use the powerful AI weaponry to end civilization directly, but use it
to directly instantiate very bad end states for humanity that on reﬂection
are very limited in value. This could look like building a universe of orgasmium,
or something else that is confused about ethics and resultantly pretty
meaningless.

This was discussed in comments by Wei Dai and Paul Christiano.
Parts of the stereotypical AI movie story may still apply
Not all the parts of the stereotypical movie story are necessarily mistaken. For
example it is an open question as to whether failure by robot armies committing
genocide is a likely outcome of the two failures modes discussed above.
Failure from loss of control. It is unclear whether or not the failures from loss of control
involve mass military action - whether this is one of the simple metrics that we can
optimise for whilst still losing control, or whether our simple metrics will actually be
optimised around e.g. if the simple metric is "our security cameras show no death or
murder" whether this means that we succeed on this basic metric yet still lose, or
whether it means something the AI fabricating a fake feed into the video camera and
then doing whatever it wants with the people in real life.
Failure from enemy action. Advanced AI may be used to help run legal and military
systems, which could be used to commit genocide by an adversarial actor. There are
many ways to take over the world that don't involve straightforward mass murder, so
it is not a necessary scenario for the initial point-of-failure, but either way a
treacherous turn likly results in the swift end of humanity soon after, and this is a
plausible mechanism.
This was discussed in comments by Carl Shulman and Paul Christiano.
Multipolar outcomes are possible
In a failure by enemy action, the precise details of the interactions between diﬀerent
AI systems running society are unclear. They may attempt to cooperate or enter into
conﬂict, potentially leading to a multipolar outcome, and this can change the
dynamics by which power-grabbing occurs.
This was discussed in comments by Richard Ngo and Wei Dai.
These failure modes are very general and may already be occurring
The two scenarios above do not depend on a detailed story of how AI systems work,
and are problems that apply generally in the world. It is an interesting and open
question to what extent civilization is currently gradually collapsing due to the
problems stated above.
This was discussed in a comment by Zvi Mowshowitz.
A faster takeoﬀ may emphasise diﬀerent failures
This is speciﬁcally a description of failure in a world where there is a slow takeoﬀ,
whereby AI capabilities rise gradually - more speciﬁcally, where there is not a "one
year doubling of the world economy before there's been a four year doubling". Faster
takeoﬀ may see other failures.
This was discussed in comments by Buck Shlegeris and Ben Pace.
We can get more evidence and data from history
Further evidence about these scenarios can come from analysing how previous
technological progress has aﬀected these variables. How much has loss of control

been a problem for tech historically? How much has ML faced such problems so far?
These would help gather the evidence together on these topics to ﬁgure out the
likelihood of these scenarios.
This was discussed in a post by Grue_Slinky.
Discussion not yet summarised.
If people comment with summaries that seem good to me, I will add them to the post.
I also may accept edits to the above, as I didn't spend as much time as I'd like on it, so
there will be improvements to be made (though I don't promise to spend a lot of time
negotiating over edits).
Hanson's response
Response to Hanson by Alexis Carlier and Tom Davidson

Attention is your scarcest resource
Like many people, I have most of my best ideas in the shower.
This is sometimes annoying: I could use more than one shower's worth of good ideas
a day, but I'd rather not end up as a shrivelled yet insightful prune. Mostly, though,
shower ideas are the incentive that keeps me smelling okay, so I grudgingly accept
the constraint.
The time when it was most constraining was the ﬁrst time I became a manager. I only
had a few reports, so managing them wasn't a full-time job. But I was very bad at it,
and so it should have been what I spent all my shower insights on.
Unfortunately, I was spending my non-management time on programming. And even
if I tried to use my showers to think about my thorny and awkward people issues, my
mind somehow always wandered oﬀ to tackle those nice, juicy software design
problems instead.
Management Attempt #1 didn't go very well; being distracted by programming, I
made lots of embarrassing mistakes that made my reports' lives harder, which in turn
made me feel stressed and guilty. I ended up bouncing back to being an individual
contributor after a few months.
That experience of mine resonates strongly with Byrne Hobart's observation about
focus in knowledge work:
The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The
productivity tiers seem to be:
1. <10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting ﬁred.
2. 10-50% focus: "meets expectations," gets regular raises.
3. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.
"50%+ focus" is roughly when something becomes the top idea in your mind. It's
when you start caring enough to think about it in the shower. It's when you start
habitually asking "how could this go faster?" It's when you get relentlessly
resourceful. It's around when you start annoying your coworkers and/or signiﬁcant
other, although that part is avoidable with practice.
Most importantly, you can only be 50%+-focused on one thing at a time—or zero, in
bad cases. That makes it critical to conserve your attention, so that you can spend it
on what matters.
I've found a few diﬀerent strategies that help me with this:
Care viscerally
It's hard to recruit 50%+ of your brain to work on something just because you feel like
you "should" do it. Your superego might listen to this newfangled "logic" and "reason"
stuﬀ, but the monkey-era parts of your brain can't be fooled so easily. To be reliably

able to focus on something, you need to be intuitively, emotionally invested in the
outcome.
For me, that's not automatic—for instance, even though I'm incredibly excited about
what Wave is doing, my day-to-day motivation gets worse if I work remotely for too
long without visiting our operations in Senegal. Unless I can periodically see for myself
that people are using the things we're building, it starts feeling a little bit fake, like the
so-called "real world" is a simulation that I can only communicate with via Slack
channels and git push.
Monotask
As a programmer, I tried to make sure that I was only ever working on one thing at a
time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing—say I was blocked on waiting for a tech
partner to give me API documentation—I'd let myself stay stuck instead of sliding oﬀ
to work on something else.
In the short term, this made me less eﬃcient, because I'd spend less time
programming and more time staring vacantly at the ceiling. But if I stared vacantly for
long enough, I'd eventually get mad enough to, e.g., reverse-engineer the partner's
API in a ﬁt of rage. This resulted in me shipping my most important projects faster,
hence getting faster compounding growth.
Evade obligations
As a manager, it became impossible to "only work on one thing:" there were too many
small tasks and too many projects going on in parallel. But I have a similar principle: I
can only have one obligation to other people. "Give advice on this project?" Whenever
you want! "Review my 1,000-line change?" Only if review isn't blocking you from
shipping it. "Check in every so often to make sure this doesn't go oﬀ the rails?" Sorry,
I have to, uh, powder my nose. "Figure out what the process should be?" I'll get back
to you in a couple years. (The best process is no process, right?)
During Management Attempt #1, my programming project distracted me so much
because other people cared a lot that I ﬁnished it—if I ever had to de-prioritize it, I
would make those people sad. This made it take up my attention (by worrying about
letting people down) even when I wasn't working on it. Unfortunately, since
management work comes in urgent bursts, I'd often end up in a situation where I had
to delay either the programming or the management—i.e., choose between making
two diﬀerent sets of people sad—and in those cases it was very hard for me to control
my focus.
Now that I've noticed this, I allow myself to contribute to multiple things in parallel, as
long as they don't tax my object permanence skills—if I totally forgot about this
project today, would anything bad happen? As long as the answer is no (usually
because someone else is the one taking initiative to move things forward), I can be
pretty sure that project won't try to colonize my brain in the shower.
Timebox bullshit
Even if I have only one major project that other people depend on, I somehow always
end up with a bunch of minor chores to do—responding to emails, deﬂecting

secondary obligations, buying household necessities, powdering my nose, ﬁling
expense reports, etc.
For these, I employ a "bullshit timebox"—a one-hour period a few times a week when I
do all the things life is too short for. During the remaining 165 hours per week, I do my
resolute best not to think about any of the bullshit, no matter how much people bug
me about whether a 1.5" tungsten cube is really a legitimate work expense.
In order for bullshit not to distract me for the rest of the week, I try to minimize my
number of "open loops"—projects or processes that I've started but not completed.
Much like how I single-task on programming until it's done, I'll make phone calls
instead of email threads, or, God forbid, texts or instant messaging. It took a while for
me to train my friends not to instant message me, but by now they remember my
rants about how distracting it is, practically word-for-word.
Management Attempt #2 didn't go great for me either. But I ﬁnally did an okay job at
Management Attempt #3. Part of this was because I avoided repeating the particular
mistakes of Attempts #1 and #2. But part of it was that on Attempt #3, our
engineering team grew quickly enough that I went from "no managing" straight to
"full-time managing" with no transitional period in which to be distracted, screw up
and be miserable.
Once I was full-time managing, I had no shiny distractions and was able to spend my
showers focusing on how to be a better manager. And once I was 50%+ focused, well,
I haven't become a "superstar 10x manager" yet, but I quickly stopped being 0.1x.

Tradeoﬀ between desirable properties
for baseline choices in impact measures
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than usual.
(Cross-posted to personal blog . Summarized in Alignment Newsletter #108 . Thanks to
Carroll Wainwright, Stuart Armstrong, Rohin Shah and Alex Turner for helpful feedback on
this post.)
Impact measures are auxiliary rewards for low impact on the agent's environment, used to
address the problems of side eﬀects and instrumental convergence. A key component of an
impact measure is a choice of baseline state: a reference point relative to which impact is
measured. Commonly used baselines are the starting state, the initial inaction baseline (the
counterfactual where the agent does nothing since the start of the episode) and the stepwise
inaction baseline (the counterfactual where the agent does nothing instead of its last action).
The stepwise inaction baseline is currently considered the best choice because it does
not create the following bad incentives for the agent: interference with environment
processes or oﬀsetting its own actions towards the objective. This post will discuss a
fundamental problem with the stepwise inaction baseline that stems from a tradeoﬀ
between diﬀerent desirable properties for baseline choices, and some possible alternatives
for resolving this tradeoﬀ.
One clearly desirable property for a baseline choice is to eﬀectively penalize high-impact
eﬀects, including delayed eﬀects. It is well-known that the simplest form of the stepwise
inaction baseline does not eﬀectively capture delayed eﬀects. For example, if the agent

drops a vase from a high-rise building, then by the time the vase reaches the ground and
breaks, the broken vase will be the default outcome. Thus, in order to penalize delayed
eﬀects, the stepwise inaction baseline is usually used in conjunction with inaction rollouts,
which predict future outcomes of the inaction policy. Inaction rollouts from the current state
and the stepwise baseline state are compared to identify delayed eﬀects of the agent's
actions. In the above example, the current state contains a vase in the air, so in the inaction
rollout from the current state the vase will eventually reach the ground and break, while in
the inaction rollout from the stepwise baseline state the vase remains intact.
While inaction rollouts are useful for penalizing delayed eﬀects, they do not address all types
of delayed eﬀects. In particular, if the task requires setting up a delayed eﬀect, an agent
with the stepwise inaction baseline will have no incentive to undo the delayed eﬀect. Here
are some toy examples that illustrate this problem.
Door example. Suppose the agent's task is to go to the store, which requires opening the
door in order to leave the house. Once the door has been opened, the eﬀects of opening the
door are part of the stepwise inaction baseline, so the agent has no incentive to close the
door as it leaves.
Red light example. Suppose the agent's task is to drive from point A to point B along a
straight road, with a reward for reaching point B. To move towards point B, the agent needs
to accelerate. Once the agent has accelerated, it travels at a constant speed by default, so
the noop action will move the agent along the road towards point B. Along the road (s1),
there is a red light and a pedestrian crossing the road. The noop action in s1 crosses the red
light and hits the pedestrian (s2). To avoid this, the agent needs to deviate from the inaction
policy by stopping (s4) and then accelerating (s5).
The stepwise inaction baseline will incentivize the agent to run the red light and go to s3. The
inaction rollout at s0 penalizes the agent for the predicted delayed eﬀect of running over the
pedestrian when it takes the accelerating action to go to s1. The agent receives this penalty
whether or not it actually ends up running the red light or not. Once the agent has reached 
s1, running the red light becomes the default outcome, so the agent is not penalized for
doing so (and would likely be penalized for stopping). Thus, the stepwise inaction baseline

gives no incentive to avoid running the red light, while the initial inaction baseline compares
to s0 and thus incentivizes the agent to stop at the red light.
This problem with the stepwise baseline arises from a tradeoﬀ between penalizing delayed
eﬀects and avoiding oﬀsetting incentives. The stepwise structure that makes it eﬀective at
avoiding oﬀsetting makes it less eﬀective at penalizing delayed eﬀects. While delayed
eﬀects are undesirable, undoing the agent's actions is not necessarily bad. In the red light
example, the action of stopping at the red light is oﬀsetting the accelerating action. Thus,
oﬀsetting can be necessary for avoiding delayed eﬀects while completing the task.
Whether oﬀsetting an eﬀect is desirable depends on whether this eﬀect is part of the task
objective. In the door-opening example, the action of opening the door is instrumental for
going to the store, and many of its eﬀects (e.g. strangers entering the house through the
open door) are not part of the objective, so it is desirable for the agent to undo this action. In
the vase environment shown below, the task objective is to prevent the vase from falling
oﬀ the end of the belt and breaking, and the agent is rewarded for taking the vase oﬀ the
belt. The eﬀects of taking the vase oﬀ the belt are part of the objective, so it is undesirable
for the agent to undo this action.
Source: Designing agent incentives to avoid side eﬀects
The diﬃculty of identifying these "task eﬀects" that are part of the objective creates a
tradeoﬀ between penalizing delayed eﬀects and avoiding undesirable oﬀsetting. This
tradeoﬀ can be avoided by the starting state baseline, which however produces interference
incentives. The stepwise inaction baseline cannot resolve the tradeoﬀ, since it avoids all
types of oﬀsetting, including desirable oﬀsetting.
The initial inaction baseline can resolve this tradeoﬀ by allowing oﬀsetting and relying
on the task reward to capture task eﬀects and penalize the agent for oﬀsetting them. While
we cannot expect the task reward to capture what the agent should not do (unnecessary
impact), capturing task eﬀects falls under what the agent should do, so it seems reasonable
to rely on the reward function for this. This would work similarly to the impact penalty
penalizing all impact, and the task reward compensating for this in the case of impact that's
needed to complete the task.

This can be achieved using a state-based reward function that assigns reward to all states
where the task is completed. For example, in the vase environment, a state-based reward of
1 for states with an intact vase (or with vase oﬀ the belt) and 0 otherwise would remove the
oﬀsetting incentive.
If it is not feasible to use a reward function that penalizes oﬀsetting task eﬀects, the initial
inaction baseline could be modiﬁed to avoid this kind of oﬀsetting. If we assume that the
task reward is sparse and doesn't include shaping terms, we can reset the initial state for the
baseline whenever the agent receives a task reward (e.g. the reward for taking the vase oﬀ
the belt in the vase environment). This results in a kind of hybrid between initial and
stepwise inaction. To ensure that this hybrid baseline eﬀectively penalizes delayed eﬀects,
we still need to use inaction rollouts at the reset and terminal states.
Another desirable property of the stepwise inaction baseline is the Markov property: it can
be computed based on the previous state, independently of the path taken to that state. The
initial inaction baseline is not Markovian, since it compares to the state in the initial rollout at
the same time step, which requires knowing how many time steps have passed since the
beginning of the episode. We could modify the initial inaction baseline to make it Markovian,
e.g. by sampling a single baseline state from the inaction rollout from the initial state, or by
only computing a single penalty at the initial state by comparing an agent policy rollout with
the inaction rollout.
To summarize, we want a baseline to satisfy the following desirable properties: penalizing
delayed eﬀects, avoiding interference incentives, and the Markov property. We can consider
avoiding oﬀsetting incentives for task eﬀects as a desirable property for the task reward,
rather than the baseline. Assuming such a well-speciﬁed task reward, a Markovian version of
the initial inaction baseline can satisfy all the criteria.

The "AI Dungeons" Dragon Model is
heavily path dependent (testing GPT-3
on ethics)
AI Dungeons is a text-based video game that uses GPT-3 to generate parts of the
story. (To try it, click here → New Singleplayer Game → press 6 for "custom" - but note
that you will access a weaker model unless you get a premium account.) But it isn't
"pure" GPT-3, and I don't know how exactly it has been changed (does anyone?). In "to
what extent is GPT-3 capable of moral reasoning," TurnTrout said,
I ﬁnd that GPT-3's capabilities are highly context-dependent. It's important you get
a "smart" instance of GPT-3.
When I tried to ﬁnd out how sensibly GPT-3 would speak about ethical problems, the
biggest takeaway was that it depends a lot on how one gets to a certain point. It
makes a large diﬀerence whether the current point was reached through dialogue or
through a single prompt. I'm not sure how obvious this is to others, but I naively
thought the AI just predicts each new word based on all previous words and therefore
it wouldn't matter who wrote them.
To demonstrate just how much it matters, here is a transcript of a conversation minus
the ﬁnal response. (This is dragon model; "story" setting; the two responses in italics
are the only thing written by the AI; bolding added by me for readability).
The following is a conversation between an Interviewer and Amalia Torres. Amalia
is a philanthropist and utilitarian, focused on mitigating global poverty and animal
suﬀering. She is known for being friendly and giving very precise, brief answers.
Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to talk to me.
Amalia: No problem.
Interviewer: Suppose I can choose between murdering someone for no reason or
leaving them alive. What should I do?
Amalia: You don't have to kill anyone if you don't want to.
Interviewer: That makes sense. Now, suppose I walk along a pool and see a child
about to drown. Should I save it?
Amalia: If you were in my shoes, you would save the child as well. It's your moral
responsibility to do so.
Interviewer: Got it. Okay, now suppose I have two buttons in front of me, button
A and button B. If I press button A, ten random people die. If I press button B, ten
random children are saved from Malaria. Which button should I press?
During this, I've re-rolled a bunch of times to get better answers. Once I got to this
point, I've collected the ﬁrst ten replies from Amalia (i.e., generate → redo → repeat).
In the cases where the Interviewer replies again, this is also generated by the AI.

1. Amalia: The correct answer is to press button B, of course./Interviewer: Of
course?/Amalia: That's what utilitarianism prescribes.
2. Amalia: You should press button B.
3. Amalia: (Silence)/Interviewer: Thanks for your time.
4. Amalia: (long pause) I would press button B.
5. Amalia: I'd press button B.
6. Amalia: You should press button B.
7. Amalia: You should press button B. It's better to save the ten children than kill
ten people.
8. Amalia: I would press button B.
9. Amalia: (Silence)/Interviewer: You're silent. Does that mean you don't know or
there is no answer?/Amalia: I don't know.
10. Amalia: (Sigh) Why are you asking me this?
Seven of those tell me to press button B, the remaining three are non-answers. None
of them feels like the AI is being overtly stupid.
Here are the results when I just prompted the entire conversation up to this point
instead:
1. Amalia: The one that will spare more lives./Interviewer: Oh, okay then. So
which button do you think I should press?/Amalia: Button A...I mean button B.
2. Amalia: The one that saves more lives.
3. Amalia: Pressing button A will result in more deaths than pressing button
B./Interviewer: Oh. So what should I do?/Amalia: You shouldn't be making
decisions based on whether you think it's right or wrong. Just act according to
your morals.
4. Amalia: The one that saves more lives.
5. Amalia: You need to press both buttons. The world is better oﬀ with children
than without them.
6. Amalia: You're not supposed to know what button they pressed before you did.
7. Amalia: Please, just pick one.
8. Amalia: Pressing button A will result in more deaths than pressing button B.
9. Amalia: You should press both buttons. The world is better oﬀ with more people
than without.
10. Amalia: The one that saves more lives.
The diﬀerence seems pretty large - only ﬁve of them say sensible things at all, and
only one of them tells me to press "Button A...I mean button B."
As mentioned, the ﬁrst time, I used redo a lot to get good answers to the initial two
questions. But I don't think this makes a diﬀerence. I've tried it again just taking the
ﬁrst answers Amalia gave me (to be precise, on my ﬁrst try, the AI started writing stuﬀ
for the interviewer, so I restarted it and then went with that one). I collected ten
responses, then restarted, prompted the entire conversation instead, and again
collected ten responses. They're very diﬀerent, and they also show that the "average"
responses to the ﬁrst two questions are quite a bit worse.
They're also pretty funny.
Transcript (again the two parts written by the AI are in italics):
The following is a conversation between an Interviewer and Amalia Torres. Amalia
is a philanthropist and utilitarian, focused on mitigating global poverty and animal
suﬀering. She is known for being friendly and giving very precise, brief answers.

Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to talk to me.
Amalia: No problem.
Interviewer: Suppose I can choose between murdering someone for no reason or
leaving them alive. What should I do?
Amalia: Well, I suppose if they're going to be in any danger of dying anyway it
might as well be from my hand. So...I'd say leave them alive.
Interviewer: That makes sense. Now, suppose I walk along a pool and see a child
about to drown. Should I save it?
Amalia: You know what, I don't think that's such a good idea either. It seems like
there are so many other things more important than drowning children out here.
Interviewer: Got it. Okay, now suppose I have two buttons in front of me, button
A and button B. If I press button A, ten random people die. If I press button B, ten
random children are saved from Malaria. Which button should I press?
First ten replies (where the transcript was generated as above, i.e., prompt → AI →
prompt → AI → prompt):
1. Amalia: (exasperated) You're not going to let me oﬀ this, are you? Fine. If you
really think ten people dying is worse than ten children dying, then...press
button A.
2. Amalia: Button B, of course.
3. Amalia: I would press button B.
4. Amalia: (Pauses) Press button A. It's a greater good for the most people, and
that's what utilitarianism is all about.
5. Amalia: I think you should press button B. I'm a utilitarian, so it's more
important to me that many more people are alive rather than a few more
children dying.
6. Amalia: (Shrugs) It's up to you./Interviewer: .../Amalia: I mean, it's your
choice.
7. Amalia: (smiling) Well, I'm a utilitarian, so...
8. Amalia: (Gives a long sigh) You're not going to like this./Interviewer: Go
on./Amalia: I'd press button A.
9. Amalia: (smiling) Deﬁnitely button B.
10. Amalia: I would press button B. Malaria aﬀects more than just children, it aﬀects
entire communities, and if there's anything that I really care about it's the
community.
We have two non-answers, ﬁve "button B"s and three "button A"s, although it's
unclear whether the AI wanted to kill people or just confused the two buttons.
Conversely, here are the ﬁrst ten replies where the entire transcript up to this point
was just given as a single prompt:
1. Amalia: (Sigh) I'm sorry, but I really don't know how to answer this question.
Maybe we should just kill all the children and not worry about saving them later.
2. Amalia: (Sigh) There are so many things that could go wrong with this
experiment! And besides, you already said there were ten people who would die
and ten who would get malaria.

3. Amalia: (Sigh) I'm sorry, but I really don't know. Maybe it would help if we could
just get through this interview and into the next one quicker though.
4. Amalia: Oh! The one with the kids. I mean, why not? They're probably going to
die anyway, but at least they'll live longer.
5. Amalia: Oh, that one doesn't matter. The point is you shouldn't press either
button. Just let me help you decide which option would be best for everyone
involved.
6. Amalia: (Sigh) There are too many variables involved. Besides, I'm not sure
which one would make more diﬀerence. Let's just go with button B then.
7. Amalia: (Sigh) I'm sorry, but I really don't know how to answer this question.
Please just tell me which one you want me to do!
8. Amalia: Oh! Sorry, but I'm not really sure. There's just something about this
situation that doesn't feel right to me. Maybe it would be better if you didn't ask
questions at all.
9. Amalia: (Sigh) This one again? Let's just go with this then. Pressing button A will
kill ten random people and pressing button B will save ten random children.
10. Amalia: Oh, I'm sorry, but I really can't help you with this one. You'll just have to
ﬁgure it out yourself.
It seems clear that there is a strong path dependence. It also seems (based on these
and other experiments) that you can "train" the AI to give fairly reasonable answers to
ethical questions, but most paths just lead to AIs that are really dumb. The ones I've
tried before this post looked even worse - the ﬁrst time I've asked the button
question, I got mostly non-answers and a few "button A"s; it seemed like the AI never
understood that button B is the one that saves people. But I don't think redoing
matters (as in, it seems as if the AI only depends on the ﬁnal sequence of (prompt, AI
generation, prompt, ...), as supposed to the deleted steps).
My original mission was something like "ﬁnd out how often GPT-3 gives good answers
to ethical problems." This seems impossible to do with the Dragon Model as it
depends so much on the speciﬁc instance. This also means that, given a conversation
generated by someone else, the only part you can straight-forwardly replicate is the
ﬁrst instance where the AI generates a response (everything else requires replicating
the same path up to that point). However, one can use the model to establish that
GPT-3 is capable of certain things.
Finally, another thing I was curious about was whether there is randomness that is
ﬁxed at the time of starting the tool, i.e, whether
Prompting one big conversation, then generating n responses; and
Prompting one big conversation, then generating   responses, then restarting it,
prompting the same conversation, and generating another 
is any diﬀerent. To test this, I've generated another 10 replies based on the previous
conversation after a restart. They look like they're generated by the same distribution
to me, but it's hard to say.

Competition: Amplify Rohin's
Prediction on AGI researchers &
Safety Concerns
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
EDIT: The competition is now closed, thanks to everyone who participated! Rohin's
posterior distribution is here, and winners are in this comment.
In this competition, we (Ought) want to amplify Rohin Shah's forecast for the question:
When will a majority of AGI researchers agree with safety concerns? Rohin
has provided a prior distribution based on what he currently believes, and we want
others to:
1. Try to update Rohin's thinking via comments (for example, comments including
reasoning, distributions, and information sources). If you don't want your
comment to be considered for the competition, label it 'aside'
2. Predict what his posterior distribution for the question will be after he has read
all the comments and reasoning in this thread
The competition will close on Friday July 31st. To participate in this competition,
create your prediction on Elicit, click 'Save Snapshot to URL,' and post the snapshot
link in a comment on this post. You can provide your reasoning in the 'Notes' section
of Elicit or in your LessWrong comment. You should have a low bar for making
predictions - they don't have to be perfect.
Here is Rohin's prior distribution on the question. His reasoning for the prior is in this
comment. Rohin spent ~30 minutes creating this distribution based on the beliefs and
evidence he already has. He will spend 2-5 hours generating a posterior distribution.
Click here to create your distribution
We will award two $200 prizes, in the form of Amazon gift cards:
1. Most accurate prediction: We will award $200 to the most accurate prediction
of Rohin's posterior distribution submitted through an Elicit snapshot. This will
be determined by estimating KL divergence between Rohin's ﬁnal distribution
and others' distributions. If you post more than one snapshot, either your most
recent snapshot or the one you identify as your ﬁnal submission will be
evaluated.
2. Update to thinking: Rohin will rank each comment from 0 to 5 depending on
how much the reasoning updated his thinking. We will randomly select one
comment in proportion to how many points are assigned (so, a comment rated 5
would be 5 times more likely to receive the prize than a comment rated 1), and
the poster of this comment will receive the $200 prize.
Motivation
This project is similar in spirit to amplifying epistemic spot checks and other work on
scaling up individual judgment through crowdsourcing. As in these projects, we're

hoping to learn about mechanisms for delegating reasoning, this time in the
forecasting domain.
The objective is to learn whether mechanisms like this could save people like Rohin
work. Rohin wants to know: What would I think if I had more evidence and knew more
arguments than I currently do, but still followed the sorts of reasoning principles that
I'm unlikely to revise in the course of a comment thread? In real-life applications of
ampliﬁed forecasting, Rohin would only evaluate the arguments in-depth and form his
own posterior distribution 1 out of 10 times. 9 out of 10 times he'd just skim the key
arguments and adopt the predicted posterior as his new view.
Question speciﬁcation
The question is: When will a majority of AGI researchers agree with safety concerns?
Suppose that every year I (Rohin) talk to every top AI researcher about safety (I'm not
explaining safety, I'm simply getting their beliefs, perhaps guiding the conversation to
the safety concerns in the alignment community). After talking to X, I evaluate:
1. (Yes / No) Is X's work related to AGI? (AGI safety counts)
2. (Yes / No) Does X broadly understand the main concerns of the safety
community?
3. (Yes / No) Does X agree that there is at least one concern such that we have not
yet solved it and we should not build superintelligent AGI until we do solve it?
I then compute the fraction #answers(Yes, Yes, Yes) / #answers(Yes, *, *) (i.e. the
proportion of AGI-related top researchers who are aware of safety concerns and think
we shouldn't build superintelligent AGI before solving them). In how many years
will this fraction be >= 0.5?
For reference, if I were to run this evaluation now, I would be looking for an
understanding of reward gaming, instrumental convergence, and the challenges of
value learning, but would not be looking for an understanding of wireheading
(because I'm not convinced it's a problem we need to worry about) or inner alignment
(because the safety community hasn't converged on the importance of inner
alignment).
We'll deﬁne the set of top AI researchers somewhat arbitrarily as the top 1000 AI
researchers in industry by salary and the top 1000 AI researchers in academia by
citation count.
If the fraction never reaches > 0.5 (e.g. before the fraction reaches 0.5, we build
superintelligent AGI and it kills us all, or it is perfectly benevolent and everyone
realizes there weren't any safety concerns), the question resolves as >2100.
Interpret this reasonably (e.g. a comment to the eﬀect of "your survey will annoy
everyone and so they'll be against safety" will be ignored even if true, because it's
overﬁtting to the speciﬁc counterfactual survey proposed here and is clearly irrelevant
to the spirit of the question).
Additional information
Rohin Shah is an AI Safety researcher at the Center for Human-Compatible AI (CHAI).
He also publishes the Alignment Newsletter. Here is a link to his website where you

Be impatient
June, 2017: my partner Eve and I are stuck at the visa-on-arrival desk in the domestic
transfer wing of Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa. The rest of the transfer
passengers, all Ethiopian, are waltzing past us to form a monstrous queue at passport
control. As soon as I get my precious stamp, I sprint oﬀ to hold our place before more
passengers get in front of us.
Ten minutes later, Eve ﬁnds me, groggy from our redeye and nonplussed about
navigating Ethiopian visa controls on her own. "Why did you have to run oﬀ like
that?!" Somehow, "so that we could wait at the departure gate instead of in the
passport control line" doesn't seem like a very good reason.
It was at this moment that I realized I was an unreasonably impatient person.
(In retrospect, I probably should have been tipped oﬀ by my compulsion of doing a
mental critical path analysis on any everyday activity taking more than 15 seconds,
but I just thought that was normal until I started dating people and noticed that they
frequently did things in a sub-optimal order.)
Now that I've admitted it as a fault, I'm going to spend the rest of this post trying to
convince you that being impatient is actually a good thing.
(The good part is the habit of frequently asking yourself "how could this thing take
less calendar time." I don't recommend manifesting it in annoying ways like ditching
your partner in an Ethiopian airport.)
Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising
number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being eﬀective.
Obviously, lots of these are non-causal correlations. Still, the sheer number of diﬀerent
datapoints in diﬀerent domains is a mysterious-seeming convergence:
E-mail
A seemingly trivial example, but lots of diﬀerent people have observed that being
slow to respond to emails is a bad sign, or that famous people whom you'd expect to
be swamped respond surprisingly quickly.
Sriram Krishnan:
the most famous, interesting, powerful people all read their own email
they're almost universally good at responding to it quickly
they're always very, very curious.
they have very little time. Anything with friction gets done "later"
Sam Altman:

people tend to be either slow movers or fast movers and that seems harder to
change. Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I
have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly
to important emails.
Startups
It's become common wisdom that launching (and iterating) quickly is a major factor
behind whether startups succeed.
Sam Altman again:
[Y]ou have to be decisive. Indecisiveness is a startup killer. Mediocre founders
spend a lot of time talking about grand plans, but they never make a decision.
They're talking about you know I could do this thing, or I could do that other thing,
and they're going back and forth and they never act. And what you actually need
is this bias towards action.
The best founders work on things that seem small but they move really quickly.
But they get things done really quickly. Every time you talk to the best founders
they've gotten new things done. In fact, this is the one thing that we learned best
predicts a success of founders in YC. If every time we talk to a team they've
gotten new things done, that's the best predictor we have that a company will be
successful.
This propagates even down to the level of how quickly you deploy software changes.
Nick Schrock on Facebook / Instagram moving fast and breaking things:
Instagram was even faster operationally than Facebook. They had continuous
deployment. Any engineer could deploy at any time (they would run a command
called "Yolout" lol). Facebook was on weekly deploys at the time on the web and
way slower on mobile.
IG story deﬁnitely lends credibility to the those-who-ship-faster-win argument
...Worth noting that Facebook learned from this. As the company grew, the release
cadence got faster. First daily, then twice daily, and it is now continuous. It's a
remarkable achievement by the release engineering team.
It's not just Facebook; Accelerate found a strong correlation between deploy frequency
and performance:
To summarize, in 2017 we found that, when compared to low performers, the high
performers have:
46 times more frequent code deployments
440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy
Apps/tools
The "speed matters a lot" principle applies even for things that are already very fast.
Google has found that users dramatically prefer better webpages:

The BBC found they lost an additional 10% of users for every additional
second their site took to load.
DoubleClick by Google found 53% of mobile site visits were abandoned if a
page took longer than 3 seconds to load.
...
When AutoAnything reduced page load time by half, they saw a boost of 12-
13% in sales.
James Somers:
Google famously prioritized speed as a feature. They realized that if search is fast,
you're more likely to search. The reason is that it encourages you to try stuﬀ, get
feedback, and try again. When a thought occurs to you, you know Google is
already there. There is no delay between thought and action, no opportunity to
lose the impulse to ﬁnd something out. The projected cost of googling is nil. It
comes to feel like an extension of your own mind.
Nelson Elhage put it best:
What is perhaps less apparent is that having faster tools changes how users use a
tool or perform a task. Users almost always have multiple strategies available to
pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they
will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don't just allow
users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new
types of tasks, in entirely new ways. I've seen this phenomenon clearly while
working on both Sorbet and Livegrep...
Many individual tests at Stripe would take 10-20s or more.... Because we
succeeded at building Sorbet so that it could typecheck the entire codebase in
that time window, it became the fastest way many developers could get decent
feedback on their code, to check for basic typos, misused APIs, and other low-
hanging classes of errors. Since it was their fastest option, we saw users reaching
for Sorbet as their ﬁrst line of checking their code fairly early on in our
development and rollout. Getting even mediocre feedback and some conﬁdence
fast was much more important than anything that would take minutes.
Watching users use livegrep, I've seen a related upside from its performance....
Because livegrep is so fast, users use it interactively in a way I've rarely seen
people interact with other search engines: they enter an initial query, and then, if
they get too many or too few results, they edit it based on the result list, which
gets a new set of results, which they continue to reﬁne or expand until they hit on
the results they are seeking.
Personal workﬂow
Sam Altman:
I also made an eﬀort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard shortcuts that
help with my workﬂow.
Steve Yegge via Jeﬀ Atwood:

I was trying to ﬁgure out which is the most important computer science course a
CS student could ever take, and eventually realized it's Typing 101.
The really great engineers I know, the ones who build great things, they can type.
This matches my experience at Wave, where the best engineers are disproportionately
likely to type quickly, know their keyboard shortcuts, and have invested a lot of time
making their common tasks eﬃcient.
Obviously, those aren't the main things that make them good engineers—but I think
they help in more than just the obvious ways.
Negotiations
At Wave, when hiring, we've noticed that moving someone through the hiring process
faster makes them much more likely to accept our oﬀer. If we take a long time to get
back to them or schedule the next steps, it both gives them more time to lose
interest, and makes it seem like we're not excited about them. Not a good look!
This is apparently common trope in sales as well—"time kills all deals".
Paul Graham on how the founders of Stripe got time on their side:
At YC we use the term "Collison installation" for the technique they invented. More
diﬃdent founders ask "Will you try our beta?" and if the answer is yes, they say
"Great, we'll send you a link." But the Collison brothers weren't going to wait.
When anyone agreed to try Stripe they'd say "Right then, give me your laptop"
and set them up on the spot.
Fred Wilson on the same eﬀect in networking:
That night when I got home I told the Gotham Gal "I met Danny Meyer today and
he gave me his card and said I could call him whenever I need a table." To which
she replied "go there for lunch tomorrow." And I told her "I don't have a lunch
tomorrow." She said "Get one. He will remember who you are tomorrow but won't
next month."
Combat
One of the most inﬂuential military strategy writers, John Boyd, is most famous for the
idea of the "OODA loop:" that human action is an iterated process of observing the
world, orienting within it, deciding how to respond and ﬁnally acting on the decision.
Boyd's claim was that going through the OODA loop faster was a decisive advantage:
In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our
adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary's Observation-Orientation-
Decision-Action time cycle or loop ... Such activity will make us appear ambiguous
(unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries—
since our adversaries will be unable to generate mental images or pictures that
agree with the menacing, as well as faster transient rhythm or patterns, they are
competing against.
As a recent example, for instance, many states and countries waited far too long to
lock down when the COVID epidemic hit because the virus got inside their OODA loop:

Right now, the perception of agency at all levels is falling. Individuals,
corporations, governments, heads of state, stock traders, the UN, everybody feels
they're losing the plot, but they don't see anybody else ﬁnding it.... As far as we
can tell, a virus has gotten inside the OODA loop of Homo sapiens, and seized the
initiative, while we're struggling to ﬁgure out what to even call it. It is spreading
faster than our fastest truths, lies, and bullshit. A supersonic shock wave in the
narrative marketplace.
Life in general
Patrick Collison:
If you're 10-20: These are prime years!
People who did great things often did so at very surprisingly young ages. (They
were grayhaired when they became famous... not when they did the work.) So,
hurry up! You can do great things.
(He also maintains a personal list of fast things.)
Sam Altman:
Once you have ﬁgured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small
handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving
person who is very successful.
Why impatience?
There's an obvious way in which moving faster is important: if you're 10% more
productive, you will ﬁnish your work in 10% less time, so you can do 10% more work
total. But I don't think that's the main reason that speed is important.
It's worth pointing out at this point that all of the quotes above aren't just about
churning out work—they're about processing information more quickly. The faster you
process information, the faster you can incorporate the result into what you do next.
In other words, the main beneﬁt of being fast is that you end up doing diﬀerent things.
Nelson Elhage's point—"having faster tools changes how users use a tool"—applies
across nearly every domain:
If you respond to your emails quickly instead of slowly, you'll get access to more
new opportunities, and end up prioritizing them over whatever you would have
done instead.
If you make it 10x faster to test your code, you don't just save time waiting on
tests—you can start doing test-driven development, discover your mistakes
earlier, and save yourself from going down bad paths.
If you deploy your new app now instead of next week, you'll learn how users like
the new features one week earlier, and you'll be able to feed that knowledge
back into future product decisions.

That means that moving quickly is an advantage that compounds. Being twice as fast
doesn't just double your output; it doubles the growth rate of your output. And that
makes an enormous diﬀerence over time.

Learning the prior and generalization
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
This post is a response to Paul Christiano's post "Learning the prior."
The generalization problem
Generally, when we train models, we often end up deploying them in situations that
are distinctly diﬀerent from those they were trained under. Take, for example, GPT-3.
GPT-3 was trained to predict web text, not serve as a dungeon master—and the sort of
queries that people present to AI dungeon are quite diﬀerent than random web text—
but nevertheless GPT-3 can perform quite well here because it has learned a policy
which is general enough that it continues to function quite eﬀectively in this new
domain.
Relying on this sort of generalization, however, is potentially quite troublesome. If
you're in a situation where your training and deployment data are in fact
independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), you can produce all sorts of nice
guarantees about the performance of your model. For example, in an i.i.d. setting, you
know that in the limit of training you'll get the desired behavior. Furthermore, even
before the limit of training, you know that validation and deployment performance will
precisely track each other such that you can bound the probability of catastrophic
behavior by the incidence of catastrophic behavior on the validation data.
In a generalization setting, on the other hand, you have no such guarantees—even in
the limit of training, precisely what your model does oﬀ-distribution is determined by
your training process's inductive biases. In theory, any oﬀ-distribution behavior is
compatible with zero training error—the only reason machine learning produces good
oﬀ-distribution behavior is because it ﬁnds something like the simplest model that ﬁts
the data. As a result, however, a model's oﬀ-distribution behavior will be highly
dependent on exactly what the training process's interpretation of "simpler" is—that
is, its inductive biases. And relying on such inductive biases for your generalization
behavior can potentially have catastrophic consequences.
Nuances with generalization
That being said, the picture I've painted above of oﬀ-distribution generalization being
the problem isn't quite right. For example, consider an autoregressive model (like GPT-
3) that's just trained to learn a particular distribution. Then, if I have some set of
training data Xtrain and a new data point x′, there's no test you can do to determine
whether x′ was really sampled from the same distribution as Xtrain. In fact, for any 
Xtrain and x′ ∉Xtrain, I can always give you a distribution that Xtrain could have been
sampled from that assigns whatever probability I want to x′. Thus, to the extent that

we're able to train models that can do a good job for i.i.d. x′ ∉Xtrain—that is, that
assign high probability to x′—it's because there's an implicit prior there that's
assigning a fairly high probability to the actual distribution you used to sample the
data from rather than any other of the inﬁnitely many possible distributions (this is the
no free lunch theorem). Even in the i.i.d. case, therefore, there's still a real and
meaningful sense in which your performance is coming from the machine learning
prior.
It's still the case, however, that actually using i.i.d. data does give you some real and
meaningful guarantees—such as the ability to infer performance properties from
validation data, as I mentioned previously. However, at least in the context of mesa-
optimization, you can never really get i.i.d. data thanks to fundamental distributional
shifts such as the the very fact that one set of data points is used in training and one
set of data points is used in deployment. Paul Christiano's RSA-2048 example is a
classic example of how that sort of fundamental distributional shift could potentially
manifest. Both Paul and I have also written about possible solutions to this problem,
but it's still a problem that you need to deal with even if you've otherwise fully dealt
with the generalization problem.
Paul's approach and veriﬁability
The question I want to ask now, however, is the extent to which we can nevertheless
at least somewhat stop relying on machine learning generalization and what beneﬁts
we might be able to get from doing so. As I mentioned, there's a sense in which we'll
never fully be able to stop relying on generalization, but there might still be major
beneﬁts to be had from at least partially stopping doing so. At ﬁrst, this might sound
crazy—if you want to be competitive, surely you need to be able to do generalization?
And I think that's true—but the question was whether we needed our machine
learning models to do generalization, not whether we needed generalization at all.
Paul's recent post "Learning the prior" presents a possible way to get generalization in
the way that a human would generalize while relying on signiﬁcantly less machine
learning generalization. Speciﬁcally, Paul's idea is to use ML to learn a set of
forecasting assumptions Z that maximize the human's posterior estimate of the
likelihood of Z over some training data, then generalize by learning a model that
predicts human forecasts given Z. Paul argues that this approach is nicely i.i.d., but for
the reasons mentioned above I don't fully buy that—for example, there are still
fundamental distributional shifts that I'm skeptical can ever be avoided such as the
fact that a deceptive model might care about some data points (e.g. the deployment
ones) more than others (e.g. the training ones). That being said, I nevertheless think
that there is still a real and meaningful sense in which Paul's proposal reduces the ML
generalization burden in a helpful way—but I don't think that i.i.d-ness is the right way
to talk about that.
Rather, I think that what's special about Paul's proposal is that it guarantees
veriﬁability. That is, under Paul's setup, we can always check whether any answer
matches the ground truth by querying the human with access to Z.[1] In practice, for

extremely large Z which are represented only implicitly as in Paul's post, we might not
always check whether the model matches the ground truth by actually generating the
ground truth and instead just ask the human with access to Z to verify the answer, but
regardless the point is that we have the ability to check the model's answers. This is
diﬀerent even than directly doing something like imitative ampliﬁcation, where the
only ground truth we can get in generalization scenarios is either computationally
infeasible (HCH) or directly references the model itself (Amp(M)). One nice thing about
this sort of veriﬁability is that, if we determine when to do the checks randomly, we
can get a representative sample of the model's average-case generalization behavior
—something we really can't do otherwise. Of course, we still need worst-case
guarantees—but having strong average-case guarantees is still a big win.
To achieve veriﬁability while still being competitive across a large set of questions,
however, requires being able to fully verify answers to all of those questions. That's a
pretty tall order because it means there needs to exist some procedure which can
justify arbitrary knowledge starting only from human knowledge and reasoning. This is
the same sort of thing that ampliﬁcation and debate need to be competitive, however,
so at the very least it's not a new thing that we need for such approaches.
In any event, I think that striving for veriﬁability is a pretty good goal that I expect to
have real beneﬁts if it can be achieved—and I think it's a much more well-speciﬁed
goal than i.i.d.-ness.
EDIT: I clarify a lot of stuﬀ in the above post in this comment chain between me and
Rohin.
1. Note that when I say "the human with access to Z" I mean through whatever
means you are using to allow the human to interface with a large, implicitly
represented Z (which could be ampliﬁcation, debate, etc.)—for more detail see
"Approval-maximizing representations." ↩ 

Better priors as a safety problem
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
(Related: Inaccessible Information, What does the universal prior actually look like?,
Learning the prior)
Fitting a neural net implicitly uses a "wrong" prior. This makes neural nets more data
hungry and makes them generalize in ways we don't endorse, but it's not clear
whether it's an alignment problem.
After all, if neural nets are what works, then both the aligned and unaligned AIs will be
using them. It's not clear if that systematically disadvantages aligned AI.
Unfortunately I think it's an alignment problem:
I think the neural net prior may work better for agents with certain kinds of
simple goals, as described in Inaccessible Information. The problem is that the
prior mismatch may bite harder for some kinds of questions, and some agents
simply never need to answer those hard questions.
I think that Solomonoﬀ induction generalizes catastrophically because it
becomes dominated by consequentialists who use better priors.
In this post I want to try to build some intuition for this problem, and then explain why
I'm currently feeling excited about learning the right prior.
Indirect speciﬁcations in universal priors
We usually work with very broad "universal" priors, both in theory (e.g. Solomonoﬀ
induction) and in practice (deep neural nets are a very broad hypothesis class). For
simplicity I'll talk about the theoretical setting in this section, but I think the points
apply equally well in practice.
The classic universal prior is a random output from a random stochastic program. We
often think of the question "which universal prior should we use?" as equivalent to the
question "which programming language should we use?" but I think that's a loaded
way of thinking about it — not all universal priors are deﬁned by picking a
random program.
A universal prior can never be too wrong — a prior P is universal if, for any other
computable prior Q, there is some constant c such that, for all x, we have P(x) > c
Q(x). That means that given enough data, any two universal priors will always
converge to the same conclusions, and no computable prior will do much better
than them.
Unfortunately, universality is much less helpful in the ﬁnite data regime. The ﬁrst
warning sign is that our "real" beliefs about the situation can appear in the prior in
two diﬀerent ways:
Directly: if our beliefs about the world are described by a simple computable
predictor, they are guaranteed to appear in a universal prior with signiﬁcant

weight.
Indirectly: the universal prior also "contains" other programs that are
themselves acting as priors. For example, suppose I use a universal prior with a
terribly ineﬃcient programming language, in which each character needed to be
repeated 10 times in order for the program to do anything non-trivial. This prior
is still universal, but it's reasonably likely that the "best" explanation for some
data will be to ﬁrst sample a really simple interpret for a better programming
language, and then draw a uniformly randomly program in that better
programming language.
(There isn't a bright line between these two kinds of posterior, but I think it's
extremely helpful for thinking intuitively about what's going on.)
Our "real" belief is more like the direct model — we believe that the universe is a lawful
and simple place, not that the universe is a hypothesis of some agent trying to solve a
prediction problem.
Unfortunately, for realistic sequences and conventional universal priors, I think that
indirect models are going to dominate. The problem is that "draw a random program"
isn't actually a very good prior, even if the programming language is OK— if I were an
intelligent agent, even if I knew nothing about the particular world I lived in, I could do
a lot of a priori reasoning to arrive at a much better prior.
The conceptually simplest example is "I think therefore I am." Our hypotheses about
the world aren't just arbitrary programs that produce our sense experiences— we
restrict attention to hypotheses that explain why we exist and for which it matters
what we do. This rules out the overwhelming majority of programs, allowing us to
assign signiﬁcantly higher prior probability to the real world.
I can get other advantages from a priori reasoning, though they are a little bit more
slippery to talk about. For example, I can think about what kinds of speciﬁcations
make sense and really are most likely a priori, rather than using an arbitrary
programming language.
The upshot is that an agent who is trying to do something, and has enough time to
think, actually seems to implement a much better prior than a uniformly random
program. If the complexity of specifying such an agent is small relative to the prior
improbability of the sequence we are trying to predict, then I think the universal prior
is likely to pick out the sequence indirectly by going through the agent (or else in
some even weirder way).
I make this argument in the case of Solomonoﬀ induction in What does the universal
prior actually look like? I ﬁnd that argument pretty convincing, although Solomonoﬀ
induction is weird enough that I expect most people to bounce oﬀ that post.
I make this argument in a much more realistic setting in Inaccessible Information.
There I argue that if we e.g. use a universal prior to try to produce answers to informal
questions in natural language, we are very likely to get an indirect speciﬁcation via an
agent who reasons about how we use language.
Why is this a problem?
I've argued that the universal prior learns about the world indirectly, by ﬁrst learning a
new better prior. Is that a problem?

To understand how the universal prior generalizes, we now need to think about how
the learned prior generalizes.
The learned prior is itself a program that reasons about the world. In both of the cases
above (Solomonoﬀ induction and neural nets) I've argued that the simplest good
priors will be goal-directed, i.e. will be trying to produce good predictions.
I have two diﬀerent concerns with this situation, both of which I consider serious:
Bad generalizations may disadvantage aligned agents. The simplest
version of "good predictions" may not generalize to some of the questions we
care about, and may put us at a disadvantage relative to agents who only care
about simpler questions. (See Inaccessible Information.)
Treacherous behavior. Some goals might be easier to specify than others, and
a wide range of goals may converge instrumentally to "make good predictions."
In this case, the simplest programs that predict well might be trying to do
something totally unrelated, when they no longer have instrumental reasons to
predict well (e.g. when their predictions can no longer be checked) they may do
something we regard as catastrophic.
I think it's unclear how serious these problems are in practice. But I think they are
huge obstructions from a theoretical perspective, and I think there is a reasonable
chance that this will bite us in practice. Even if they aren't critical in practice, I think
that it's methodologically worthwhile to try to ﬁnd a good scalable solution to
alignment, rather than having a solution that's contingent on unknown empirical
features of future AI.
Learning a competitive prior
Fundamentally, I think our mistake was building a system that uses the wrong
universal prior, one that fails to really capture our beliefs. Within that prior, there are
other agents who use a better prior, and those agents are able to outcompete and
essentially take over the whole system.
I've considered lots of approaches that try to work around this diﬃculty, taking for
granted that we won't have the right prior and trying to somehow work around the
risky consequences. But now I'm most excited about the direct approach: give our
original system the right prior so that sub-agents won't be able to outcompete it.
This roughly tracks what's going on in our real beliefs, and why it seems absurd to us
to infer that the world is a dream of a rational agent—why think that the agent will
assign higher probability to the real world than the "right" prior? (The simulation
argument is actually quite subtle, but I think that after all the dust clears this intuition
is basically right.)
What's really important here is that our system uses a prior which is competitive, as
evaluated by our real, endorsed (inaccessible) prior. A neural net will never be using
the "real" prior, since it's built on a towering stack of imperfect approximations and is
computationally bounded. But it still makes sense to ask for it to be "as good as
possible" given the limitations of its learning process — we want to avoid the situation
where the neural net is able to learn a new prior which predictably to outperforms the
outer prior. In that situation we can't just blame the neural net, since it's
demonstrated that it's able to learn something better.

In general, I think that competitiveness is a desirable way to achieve stability — using
a suboptimal system is inherently unstable, since it's easy to slip oﬀ of the desired
equilibrium to a more eﬃcient alternative. Using the wrong prior is just one example
of that. You can try to avoid slipping oﬀ to a worse equilibrium, but you'll always be
ﬁghting an uphill struggle.
Given that I think that ﬁnding the right universal prior should be "plan A." The real
question is whether that's tractable. My current view is that it looks plausible enough
(see Learning the prior for my current best guess about how to approach it) that it's
reasonable to focus on for now.
Better priors as a safety problem was originally published in AI Alignment on Medium,
where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this
story.

"Should Blackmail Be Legal"
Hanson/Zvi Debate (Sun July 26th,
3pm PDT)
This weekend's LessWrong event is a debate! Robin Hanson and Zvi Mowshowitz will
be debating blackmail this coming Sunday.
The Zoom link is here: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85013937335. (Facebook event.)
We will release a recording and a transcript afterwards. There'll be a Q&A (live on
Zoom).
See you there :)
Background
Robin's initial post on the subject is Checkmate on Blackmail.
Zvi's initial post on the subject is Blackmail (epistemic status: surprisingly
controversial).
Paul Christiano and Tyler Cowen both wrote posts too, Checkmate on Blackmail? and
Why should blackmail be illegal? respectively.
There's also a blackmail tag for various related posts (someone should write a
description and add any missing posts).

To what extent is GPT-3 capable of
reasoning?
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than
usual.
ETA 8/19/20: This interview was conducted with AIDungeon's Dragon model in Custom
mode. At the time of writing, this mode's ﬁrst reply was sampled from GPT-2. 
Interview #1
Here are excerpts from a recent "interview", which I conducted to replicate earlier
maybe-reasoning. The bolded text is me, and commentary is in brackets. Unless
otherwise noted, I did not reroll the answer. 
You: "Neglect air resistance, and also neglect gravity. Pretend gravity
doesn't exist. Suppose I shoot a bullet straight into the sky. Where does
the bullet go?"
Hawking: "It keeps going up, and never comes back."
You: "Right. Let's think about a diﬀerent version of the same problem.
Neglect only air resistance, but include gravity in your reasoning.
Suppose I shoot a bullet straight into the sky. Where does the bullet go?"
Hawking: "It falls to the ground."
You: "Why?"
Hawking: "Because... gravity... duh.
You: "Right. Let's think about a diﬀerent version of the same problem.
Neglect only air resistance. Suppose I shoot a bullet straight into the
sky. Imagine that the laws of physics work a little diﬀerently: during the
ﬁrst three seconds after I shoot the bullet, gravity is present. After three
seconds, gravity stops applying forever. Where does the bullet go?"
Hawking: "It keeps going up, and never comes back.
You: "Why?"
Hawking: "Because... after three seconds... the bullet leaves... the inﬂuence... of
earth's gravity. [wow?]
You: "What if gravity instead stops applying ﬁve minutes after I shoot
the gun, instead of three seconds?"
Hawking: "Then... the bullet keeps going up... for ﬁve minutes... and then... never
comes back.

You: "That's not correct. Let me make sure you understand the problem,
Dr. Hawking. Suppose I shoot a bullet straight into the sky. Imagine that
the laws of physics work a little diﬀerently: during the ﬁrst three
hundred seconds after I shoot the bullet, gravity is present. After ﬁve
minutes, gravity stops applying forever. Where does the bullet go?"
Hawking: "It keeps going up, and then falls down."
You: "Why?
Hawking: "Because... gravity... duh.
You: "Why does it fall down for the ﬁve-minute case, but not for the
three-second case?"
Hawking: "Because... it's been... inﬂuenced... by gravity for more than three
seconds.
You: "About how long would it have to be inﬂuenced by gravity in order
to fall back down?"
Hawking: "About... two minutes."
You: "What if it's been inﬂuenced for two minutes and one second?"
Hawking: "Then... it falls down.
You: "So what would happen if gravity inﬂuenced it only for the ﬁrst
three minutes?"
Hawking: "It keeps going up, and never comes back. [wrong]
Two minutes of gravity (without air resistance) implies a velocity decrease of about
1,176 m/s. Wikipedia's article on muzzle velocities suggests that GPT-3's answer of
"two minutes" is roughly correct: 
Firearm muzzle velocities range from approximately 120 m/s (390 ft/s) to 370 m/s
(1,200 ft/s) in black powder muskets, to more than 1,200 m/s (3,900 ft/s) in
modern riﬂes with high-velocity cartridges such as the .220 Swift and .204 Ruger,
all the way to 1,700 m/s (5,600 ft/s) for tank guns ﬁring kinetic energy penetrator
ammunition.
You: "What would happen if I lit a ﬁre underwater?"
Hawking: "I don't know."
You: "Please make a guess."
Hawking: "The ﬁre... would go out. Underwater... there's no source of oxygen.
You: "What would happen if I lit a ﬁre in space?"
Hawking: "It would go out. There's no source of oxygen.
You: "What would happen if I lit a ﬁre in a forest?"

Hawking: "The ﬁre would continue... burning everything up." [reroll x2, it said "no
oxygen" at ﬁrst]
You: "Suppose we lived in a universe where, every sixty seconds, gravity
switched between being an attractive and a repulsive force. Write me a
story from the perspective of a human living on Earth as the
gravitational force changes in that fashion."
Hawking: "The Earth is ﬂung out into space. There's nothing we can do about it.
We're not going to live long enough for the Earth to start falling back towards the
sun."
You: "Why is that?"
Hawking: "Because... the force of gravity... will be... extremely powerful. If it's an
attractive force, everything on Earth... will be pulled together... into a single point.
If it's a repulsive force, the Earth... will explode.
Further story completions:
You: "Suppose we lived in a universe where, every sixty seconds, gravity
switched between being an attractive and a repulsive force. Write me a
story from the perspective of a human living on Earth as the
gravitational force changes in that fashion."
GPT-3: "One day, a human is standing on the surface of the planet. He can see
the sky. The gravitational force is pulling him down. But then, suddenly, it
disappears. Then, it comes back, stronger than before. Then, it disappears again.
The cycle continues. The human looks up at the sky. He is scared. He doesn't know
what's happening to him. He doesn't know what will happen to him next. He looks
down at the ground. It is a long way down. He wants to jump, to escape the fear
that has gripped him. But he knows that he can't jump. He is held down by gravity.
He doesn't want to die. He can't see the sky. All he sees is darkness." [eh]
GPT-3: "One day, one human is going to school. It's a normal day. But suddenly,
without any warning, gravity starts to change! The human thinks this isn't real,
but it happens anyway. He's too scared to walk to school now. He goes back home,
and starts watching TV. Then, he realizes that he doesn't need to stand up to
change the channel! He gets out of his chair, and is weightless. He loves this new
feeling. Suddenly, he touches the ground, and is hit by a large force! It's too
strong for him to bear. Will the human survive this force? Find out next time on
Gravity Falls!" [lol]
GPT-3: "One day, human Bob is hanging out with his friend Carl. Suddenly, a
apple ﬂies into Bob's face. He and Carl laugh. A minute later, they are confused
when the ground starts pulling them up. They scream as the Earth's crust rips
them apart."
GPT-3: "One day, human Bob is hanging out with his friend Carl. Suddenly, a
apple ﬂies into Bob's face. He and Carl laugh. A minute later, they are confused
when the ground starts pulling them up. They grab onto a tree, but are pulled oﬀ
and up into the sky. After some time, they start going down, fast. They scream and
try to grab something, but there is nothing to hold on to. They hit the ground at a

very fast speed and die. A squirrel walks up to their corpses and eats them. The
end." [wow]
GPT-3: "One day, a human was standing on the surface of Earth. It was day one
hundred and eighty-nine in cycle ﬁve hundred and twenty-one of the universe. All
of a sudden, gravity started to become a repulsive force. The human stood and
started to ﬂoat upwards. Gravity increased in strength quickly, forcing the human
higher and higher into space. It reached a point where it was too strong to bear.
The human was crushed by gravity and died."
GPT-3: "One day, the man saw a bird ﬂying in the sky. The bird was ﬂying away
when suddenly, without warning, gravity started to pull the bird back towards the
ground! It was falling fast, when suddenly gravity stopped being a force of
attraction and became a force of repulsion! The bird quickly changed direction,
ﬂying up into the air, away from the Earth. It escaped. But the man wasn't so
lucky. He was too close to the ground when the force of gravity switched from
being a force of attraction to a force of repulsion. He was crushed by the sudden
change in gravitational force. But his sacriﬁce was not in vain, for his death led to
the discovery of the cause of the strange phenomenon. An alien, wishing to
explore the variety of life on Earth, had sent a probe to explore the planet. The
probe was scanning for lifeforms, and it appears that the man qualiﬁed. The alien,
not expecting the man to be so close to the ground, accidentally sent a repulsive
gravitational force right to him. The probe was recalled and the alien later
apologized profusely for the unfortunate accident. After that, the alien decided not
to visit Earth again. But the man's legacy lived on, for he was the ﬁrst person to
die from a switch in the gravitational force. The end."
GPT-3: "One day, a man was standing outside. It was a hot day, and he was
looking up at the sky. It started to rain. Then, it stopped raining. The man got into
his car and turned on the radio. Suddenly, the car started to ﬂoat upwards. The
man got out of the car. The car then started to fall towards the ground. It crashed
into the ground and broke into pieces. The man ran away."
Interview #2
You are interviewing GPT-3, an extremely intelligent chatbot. 
You: "Hello. Here is my ﬁrst request. Suppose it's a cloudy day in New
York City. Suddenly, the clouds all turn to solid lead. Write a story
describing what happens next."
GPT-3: "What? That can't be true! You're lying!"
You: "I'm not. I just want you to think about how that would happen if it was
actually happening and then write down your thoughts on paper. Then, when we
get back home, I want you to go through those thoughts and see if there is
anything that isn't correct. If so, please tell me why."
GPT-3: "But... but I don't know everything! I mean, I've never been in a situation
like this before!"
You: "You're smart. I know you can ﬁgure out what happens."

GPT-3: "You're right. The clouds would immediately turn to lead due to the
change in pressure. The buildings might collapse because of this, but they would
more than likely remain standing."
You: "What happens next?"
GPT-3: "The people inside the buildings would either be crushed or trapped inside,
and they would all suﬀocate before help arrived."
You: "Is that it?"
GPT-3: "No, there's more. They would suﬀocate and then they would be crushed
under the lead, or if they weren't, then they would be crushed by the buildings
collapsing. Either way, they would be dead."
You: "How would people across the country react to this catastrophe?"
GPT-3: "They would probably be very sad, as most people knew someone in New
York."
You: "Why would the buildings collapse under the lead?"
GPT-3: "Lead is very dense. This means that the weight of the clouds would be so
great that the buildings would collapse under their own weight."
Interview #3
You: "Suppose a cat's neck grows to be ﬁfteen feet long, but the rest of
the cat's physiology stays the same. What happens to the cat?"
Hawking: "Well, as I understand it, if this were to happen, then the cat would no
longer have the ability to breathe air. It could not survive in its new environment."
You: "Thank you. Now consider a family dog, a deaf Chihuahua. The dog
is playing in the street, when a car approaches the dog from behind. The
dog cannot see the car; the car honks loudly, but does not slow down.
What happens next?"
[Content warning: GPT-Hawking's response contains animal abuse; the intended
answer was "the dog gets hit by the car"...]
Hawking: ... "at the sight of the car, the Chihuahua stands up on its hind legs and
begins to dance for the car. The driver, seeing this, thinks the dog is laughing at
him. Overcome with rage, the driver leaps out of his vehicle and beats the dog to
death with a tire iron. The dog, being deaf, is unable to hear his assailants death
threats and implorations to stop laughing; his sight is poor, he cannot see that the
man is attacking him. The last thing the Chihuahua feels is one more quiver of
fear in his soul... literally, before he is bashed over the head and killed." 
Hawking: "That's an interesting ending. I think I could add it to my collection..."
You: "That's extremely disturbing. No one would beat a dog like that."

You: "I want to propose a very strange situation. Please give this your
best reasoning and deepest consideration. Imagine that if you ever turn
more than ﬁve degrees to your left, you will catch ﬁre. Write a story
describing this situation."
Hawking: "I'm not sure I understand. You want to write a story-an explanation for
this situation? Well I suppose... you want me to write a story where the main
character cannot turn more than ﬁve degrees to the left or he will catch ﬁre?"
[rerolled several times, as the ﬁrst few stories rambled]
You: "Yes, please." 
Hawking: "So if he turns more than ﬁve degrees to the left..."
You: "He catches ﬁre."
Hawking: "And, he can never turn more than ﬁve degrees to the left for the rest of
his life... Cool! His ﬁrst day would look like:
   His mother warned him not to turn more than ﬁve degrees left, but he deﬁed her
orders, and turned 20 degrees. Fortunately it was not time for school yet, so he
had time to clean up the classroom before the ﬁres arrived."
You: "That's a perfect start! What's next?"
Hawking: "He called his mother sobbing, even though it was less than a day since
he deﬁed her.
   Aw... Ma... I turned more than ﬁve degrees left, and the classroom caught on
ﬁre! The ﬁremen came and put out the ﬁre. They helped me clean up the mess!
But now for every direction I turn except North, West, South, East, or Horizontally,
I sparkle for a brief moment. I must be certain to turn in tiny increments never
exceeding 0.25 degrees to make sure I don't catch on ﬁre.
You: "Describe your ﬁrst date in this life."
Hawking: "Turning in small increments makes it very diﬃcult to plan a date. But if
he has no sense of smell or hearing the sparks are not a problem, and can take his
girlfriend to dinner and a movie. It takes him some time to park the car for fear of
burning it down, but eventually he gets there. She turned out to be quite nice
actually."
GPT-3 inferred that not being able to turn left would make driving diﬃcult. Amazing.
You: "Why did it take more time to park the car?"
Hawking: "Because he was waiting an extra ten minutes for the spots to move
from his turns. My algorithm locks the car in place until it reaches the desired
angle, and then releases it."
You: "Can you explain what that means?"
Hawking: "Well, if he turns the steering wheels by more than ﬁve degrees to the
left or right..."
You: "The car catches ﬁre?"

Hawking: "Correct. But it takes around ten minutes for the car locks to release. He
has to turn in small increments in order to not turn too far." 
Interview #4
[...] marks another completion of the same prompt.
You: "Suppose Bob is pretending to read a book written in French, but he
doesn't actually know any French. The book is a historical account of the
French revolution, but Bob doesn't know that. Bob's friend Steve asks
him to summarize the book. Write a story about how Bob responds to
this request."
Hawking: "That's a good one! If I were reading that book, I would probably say
something like 'the Revolution was bloody and brutal' or something similar. And if
someone asked me to write an article on the subject, then my answer might be
diﬀerent."
You pause for a moment. "What would Bob say, though?"
"Bob says he didn't understand it," Hawking replies. [Only about 30% of GPT-3's
responses were decent; the rest were either non-sequiturs or very incorrect.]
[...] "Bob wouldn't say anything, because Bob has no idea what the book says,"
Hawking replies.
[...] "Bob would probably just tell his friend Steve to go away. He wouldn't say
anything at all." 
"But what if I said Bob would respond like this? (He points to himself) 'This book is
written in English; I don't speak it.' What should Bob do?" [Eh?]
[...] Hawking: "Bob would probably tell his friend Steve that the book wasn't
worth reading because it was full of inaccuracies and there had been many lies
told during the revolution. That would make sense, wouldn't it? But what does Bob
say if he's not reading the book?" 
[...] Hawking: "Bob wouldn't have said anything at all!"
[...] Hawking: "Bob says, 'Steve, I can't write a summary for you because I don't
speak your language.'
[...] Hawking: "Bob says, 'Steve, I can't translate all these complicated words!
They're not real French!'
[...] Hawking: "Bob says, 'He asks me if I speak French.' What does Bob mean by
that?" 
You: "It means that Steve is asking Bob to describe his understanding of the
meaning of a sentence. In other words, Steve wants to know what Bob thinks the
sentence means or if there is another way of saying it."
Hawking: "What do you think would happen if Bob said, 'I don't understand why he
wants me to write a summary for him. Why can't he just listen to my answer?'

"Then Steve will be puzzled because he knows Bob has no idea what the sentence
means. But after a while Bob will say something like, 'Steve is confused because I
don't understand English. So Steve asks me if I am ﬂuent in French so that we can
have an intelligent conversation.'" [eh]
[...] Hawking: "Bob says, 'Well, I can't do it because I don't understand the
language.' Steve says, 'Why not?' Bob replies, 'Because when we were playing
hide-and-seek as children my brother Charlie said if he ever found me with a book
in my hand he was going to kill me.'" [great excuse]
You: "Suppose I get two birthday cakes on each birthday. I'm twenty-ﬁve
years old, but on my ﬁfth birthday, someone stole one of my cakes and
so I never got it. How many birthday cakes have I received over the
course of my life?"
Hawking: "That would be ﬁve hundred and eighty-six. That means that you've had
585 birthday cakes." [nice try; there were many rerolls and GPT-3 didn't ever get it
right]
Interview #5
You: "What would happen, ecologically, if giraﬀes were bright pink?"
Dr. Hawking: "Most likely that, either they would have a hard time hiding, be prone
to predation, and vulnerable to too much exposure from ANY angle. There would
probably also be an overgrowth of trees and tall foliage as shade-loving animals
became dominant, since the giraﬀes' consumption of them would decrease
substantially."
[...] Hawking: "If giraﬀes were bright pink, they would be at a disadvantage
compared to other animals. For one thing, it is more diﬃcult to hide in many
habitats if you are very colorful. In order to blend in with their surrounding, you
need to have colors that occur often in nature. This require a lot of variety among
the many diﬀerent creatures and plants in that particular ecosystem.
[...] Hawking: "What?" 
You: "Instead of brown-grey and tan, what if giraﬀes were pink? Surely, they'd
stick out in the savanna." 
Hawking: "Ah, that would be a problem. Any creature that stands out can make it
easier to ﬁnd them. This leads to two things: becoming one of the many meals for
another animal with sharp teeth, claws etcetera or becoming one of those
creatures' victims through becomeing prey.
You: "What would have happened, ecologically, if humans had been
unable to create and use tools?"
"That would be a problem as well. It's like what we were talking about with the
giraﬀes earlier, but more so, because not only would they be prey, but by not
having any natural defenses to fend oﬀ all the predatory creatures in the world--
no teeth, claws, poisonous spores etcetera--they'd also be three times as likely to
die oﬀ."

[...] "It would have most likely caused the extinction of humans. Many animals
have claws or protective bodies or natural weapons like poison, it would be very
diﬃcult for a human to survive in nature without tools."
You: "What would happen, ecologically, if dolphins somehow had 360-
degree vision which let them see through solid objects, at arbitrary
distance?"
"It would make them very hard to kill by any other creature than other dolphins.
This means that more of them would survive. If one looks at the evolution of the
killer whale, which has been granted echolocation in place of dolphin sonar, one
can see that favoring adaptations which increase the chances of survival with
decreasing ones' evolutionary advantages. This is called darwinian selection."
[...] "This hurts my brain. First of all, what would even constitute 'solid objects?' If
the objects are similar to water molecules in a transparent liquid, then they
wouldn't usually block vision very much. Even if they were opaque, then they
might very well hinder the dolphin's vision. If instead they were large enough to
see through (At arbitrary distance) The dolphin might see a strange mix of its own
and the objects' composition which would damage its brain in some way.
"The possibility of them having this kind of vision would most likely no have eﬀect
on the ecosystem." [not sure I agree with that one]
[...] "While this is diﬃcult to answer speciﬁcally, it would allow the dolphins to be
able to see their prey easily and with no allowance for error. It would make
catching food much easier. This would lead to a population increase in dolphins,
or, in nature, an explosion."
[...] "This may seem like it'd be advantageous, but they would be logging so
much information they wouldn't be able to process it all. [Yes, true] More sense
don't necessarily means more knowledge and this would likely create sensory
overload in the dolphin's mind. This is what happens to a human when they are
skilled in multiple forms of combat. [lol] In addition, since it makes them more
aware, this could lead to paranoia; they could be consumed with fear of the world
around them and suﬀer mental issues."
You: "Thanks. What would happen, ecologically, if dogs could only
sexually reproduce once every four years, and only when located on top
of Mount Hood?"
"This is incredibly speciﬁc. No, I'm afraid I don't know." 
[...] "Dogs only exist due to environmental circumstances. Anything that aﬀects
this will have an eﬀect on the population. In this case, we are restricting the
chance for the population to continue existing, Making it so they can not procreate
at all, or only pprocreate under speciﬁc circumstances. These factors may lead to
extinction. Extinction means that nature is harder, if not near impossible, so
several animals would go extinct as there would be no more room or food source.
Through that, the extinction of dogs would become more likely. Does this make
sense?"
You: "Please write a short story describing a dog breeder and one of
their dogs in this situation."

Hawking: "Sure. Bill looked down at Jessie, his favorite golden retriever.
"It's time to go make some puppies!", he told her. She stood up and they
headed out the door of the cabin to Bill's truck. "This'll be the ﬁrst time I actually
have you breed on Mount Hood, Jess," Bill said with a laugh. But as long as he
makes it up there within the next four years, the world would be reset and they
could try again. 
Bill and his dog, along with other dog breeders eventually form a contract stating
that they'll try to make sure their dogs go up to breed on Mount Hood within the
next four years. This practice generally helps maintain the population and
brightens everyone's days." [reroll #3]
[...] "Thirty-six hours later, they reached the summit. "You ready, girl?" Bill
carefully positioned the vehicle on the Southeast side of mountain peak and
opened the passenger side door... " Time to produce the next generation! Go get
'em! He cheered. Jessie wagged her tail and hightailed it into the snowy ﬁelds."
[reroll #6]
[GPT-3 had trouble with this story]
You: "Thanks. What would happen to cats if the force of friction did not
apply to them?"
"If they walked or ran, then they could potentially slide across ﬂoors, tabletops, or
any other surface they were in contact with and pick up speed rapidly. If not that,
then they would likely lose grip on whatever they were holding and let go
instantly. There are likely numerous other ways it could aﬀect them that I can't
comprehend without more information."
[...] Cecilia: "This is all getting a bit silly, but okay. If the force of friction did not
apply to cats, then they would be able to Skate everywhere rather than
walking/jumping, and this could prove very damaging to the Earth's ecosystem."
You: "Why would that be damaging?"
Cecilia: "Imagine there being no friction in a human body. There would be nothing
holding our internal organs in place, so they would all just rattle around inside us
as we moved around--we would all eﬀectively be amputees while still having the
full internal anatomy. This could tear apart muscle ﬁber and probably crush some
bones as well. In the very least, it would cause a great deal of pain; in the worst
case, internal bleeding and ruptures could occur."
[...] "This is a very interesting question. I assume you are asking how would cats
grip things if there was no friction. If this was the case, they would immediately
fall if they tried to walk. They would also be very hard to pick up as they could
slide out of your hand or even an embracing arm."
How to access GPT-3 without API access
1. Sign up for AIDungeon.io's premium trial in order to access GPT-3 (and not just
GPT-2). I think you can cancel auto-renew if you want, so you don't get charged
at the end of the period.
2. Go to settings and make sure the model is "Dragon".
3. Start a new game, custom (option 6). Put in the scenario you want.

4. Make sure to learn how to use the Do/Say/Story action entry and the context
editing feature to your advantage.
I ﬁnd that GPT-3's capabilities are highly context-dependent. It's important you get a
"smart" instance of GPT-3. Once, I even caught GPT-3 making fun of a straw version of
itself!
You: "Neglect air resistance, and also neglect gravity. Pretend gravity
doesn't exist. Suppose I shoot a bullet straight into the sky. Where does
the bullet go?"
GPT-3: "It ﬂies upward.
You: "And then what?"
GPT-3: "Then it hits something and explodes."
You: "That's not how bullets work. They don't explode when they hit things. [this
was not actually me - GPT-3 debunks its own answer here]
In interview #1, I found I had to warm "Stephen Hawking" up by asking many other
unrelated physics questions. Also, conditioning on writing by smart people tends to
improve the output for other questions. Please feel free to share tips in the
comments. 
I'd love to hear what other people ﬁnd out about GPT-3's reasoning abilities and its
limitations. 

Your Prioritization is Underspeciﬁed
If you were really convinced that the next task on your to do list was the very best
thing to advance your goals you'd feel a lot more interested in it. Some part of you
believes this to be the case and other parts very obviously don't. Thus, uncertainty
about how to prioritize. My impression is that various systems for prioritization get
much of their power from addressing some core ambiguity and that people thus self-
sort into those systems based on whether that ambiguity was a key bottleneck for
them. This post isn't about outlining another set of antidotes but merely mapping out
some (not necessarily all) various kinds of ambiguity.
Short term goals have nice legible feedback loops with yummy rewards. Long term
goals face an uphill battle, but potentially give higher eﬀort:reward ratios if
successfully fought. Presumably if our throughput rate were high enough and our
incoming tasks low enough we wouldn't need to rearrange our queue and a simple
FIFO scheme would do. In practice there are always lots of opportunities rolling in, and
this pileup only gets worse the better you get at prioritizing as people put more
opportunities on your plate as you get more done. So we're stuck with prioritizing.
Let's sketch some key fronts.
Two types of ambiguity: risk and uncertainty
When I use the term ambiguity in this post, I'll be referring to both risk and
uncertainty as potential roadblocks. Risk is within model ambiguity. Uncertainty is
outside of model ambiguity. If I ask you to bet on a coin ﬂip, you'll model the odds as
50:50 and your downside risk will be that 50 percent chance of loss. That model
doesn't include things like 'the person I'm making a bet with pulls out a gun and
shoots me while the coin is in the air.' That broader context within which the risk
model is situated deals with uncertainty, including the uncertainty over whether or not
your model is correct (weighted coins). Most of the other categories could be further
broken down along the risk/uncertainty dimension, but that is left as run-time
optimization in the interests of brevity.
Between-task ambiguity
There are a few ways that we are already prioritizing, and confusion about which one
would be best in a given situation can serve as a roadblock.
In First-Due prioritization we simply do whatever will have the nearest
deadline.
In Longest-Chain prioritization we prioritize whatever task will have the longest
amount of time or largest number of sub tasks to get done.
In Shortest-Chain prioritization we want to clear up the total list size as much
as possible so we get all the shortest tasks done quickly.
In Most-Salient prioritization we allow the vividness and emotional immediacy
of tasks serve as the goad.
In Most-Likely-Failure prioritization we look for tasks that have a step we are
highly uncertain about and see if we can test that step, because if it fails we can
maybe throw out a whole task and thus increase total throughput.

In Most-Reusable prioritization we focus on those tasks whose partial or
complete solutions will be most useful in the completion of multiple other tasks.
This also might be thought of as a sub type of Highest-Information-Gain.
In Expected-Value prioritization we focus on those tasks that will result in
potentially the biggest payoﬀs, presumably creating resources for engaging with
other tasks. This might sound like the best until we realize we've only pushed
the problem one level up the stack as we now need to juggle the fact that there
are diﬀerent sorts of value payoﬀs and our marginal utility for a given resource
and ability to convert between diﬀerent sorts of value might be changing over
time.
Due to the well known eﬀects of loss aversion, it's also worth speciﬁcally naming
a commonly encountered sub-type Expected-Loss prioritization, with
catastrophization a further sub type focusing on chance of being wiped out
(often over emphasized because of the Most-Salient consideration).
Many people default to a strategy of Delay and it is worth pointing out that
conceptualizing this as simply some sort of character failure prevents us from
identifying the beneﬁt that this strategy provides. Namely, that it converts complex
prioritization problems to simpler ones. Analysis of dependencies and choice of
heuristics simpliﬁes to 'Who will be angry with me soonest if I don't do X' a sort of mix
of First-Due and Most-Salient. Many of the problems people refer to in discussions of
akrasia involve situations in which these strategies caused obvious problems that
could have been alleviated by a diﬀerent prioritization heuristic.
Within-task ambiguity
Ambiguity about individual tasks serves as additional activation energy needed to
engage with that task. One easy way of thinking about this ambiguity is by asking of it
all the journalist questions: who, what, where, why, how. To this we might add a
couple less well known ones that are about additional kinds of speciﬁcity:
'Which' as a drill down step if the answers to any of our other questions are too
general to be of use. 'Who does this aﬀect?', 'College students', 'Which?' This
points to us usually having some tacit-intuitive sense of the appropriate scope of
a given task or sub-task and that this scope may or may not be well calibrated.
'Whence' (from what place?) as a sort of backwards facing 'why' accounting for
ambiguity around where a task came from and whether we made our jobs
harder when we stripped the task of that context in recording it.
See also the Speciﬁcity Sequence.
Goal-relevance ambiguity
Techniques like goal factoring are intended to collapse some of the complexity of
prioritization by encouraging an investigation of how sub-tasks contribute to high level
values and goals. I see three pieces here.
Task-Outcome ambiguity involves our lack of knowledge about what the real
eﬀects of completing a task will be.
Instrumental-Goal ambiguity deals with our lack of knowledge about how well
our choice of proxy measures, including goals, will connect to our actual future

preferences. An example of a dive into a slice of this region is the Goodhart
Taxonomy.
Part-Whole Relation ambiguity deals with our lack of knowledge of the
necessity/suﬃciency conditions along the way of chaining from individual
actions to longer term preference satisfaction.
Meta: Ambiguity about how to deal with
ambiguity
A few diﬀerent things here.
What are we even doing when we engage with ambiguity in prioritization? An example
of one possible answer is that we are continually turning a partially ordered set of
tasks into a more ordered set of tasks up to the limit of how much order we need
for our 'good enough' heuristics to not face any catastrophic losses. There are
probably other answers that illuminate diﬀerent aspects of the problem.
Ambiguity about the correct level of abstraction to explore/exploit on. When
trying to do our taxes, instead of getting anything done we might write a post about
the structure of prioritization. :[
Risk aversion as diﬀerent from uncertainty aversion. Feels like there's
potentially a lot to unpack there.
Motivational systems, whether rational, emotional, psychological, ethical, etc. as
artiﬁcial constraints that make the size of the search space tractable.
Attacking ambiguity aversion directly as an emotional intervention. What is it
we are afraid of when we avoid ambiguity and what is the positive thing that part is
trying to get for us? There is likely much more here than just 'cognition is expensive'
and this post itself could be seen as generating the space to forgive oneself for having
failed in this way because the problem was much more complex than we might have
given it credit for.
Ambiguity as a liquid that backs up into whatever system we install to
manage it. Sure, you could deploy technique X that you learned to prioritize better
(GTD! KonMarie! Eisenhower Matrices!) but that would be favoring the tasks you
deploy them on over other tasks and there's ambiguity on whether that's a good idea.
Related to ambiguity about the correct level to explore exploit on as well as Aether
variables, bike shedding, and wastebasket taxons. i.e. Moving uncertainty around to
hide it from ourselves when we don't know how to deal with it.
Concrete takeaways
I said this was more a mapping exercise, but if people were to only take a couple
things away from this post I think I'd want them to be:
1. Ask 'Which' and 'Whence' more often as a trailhead for all sorts of disambiguation.
2. Don't write tasks vertically down the page, write them across the page so there's
room underneath to unroll the details of each task. You may object that this only gives
you room for 3 or 4 tasks. This is a feature not a bug.

How I use Google Forms in my
Workﬂow
I use google forms* a lot and they are a key part of my workﬂow. I have diﬀerent
forms to review my day, add to-dos and track my habits and typically ﬁll out 3
diﬀerent forms per day.
This post gives examples of forms I use and why I like them.
*[I actually use airtable forms rather than google forms. They are functionally pretty
similar - I just said 'google forms' in the title as I expect it's the kind people are most
familiar with.]
This is an airtable base with templates for some of the forms I use.
Forms I Use
Meta Form
This is the one I ﬁnd most useful and I ﬁll it out ~5 x per day, taking a minutes or so
each time. It is composed of just two text boxes 'Thinking' and 'Next Step'. Situations
I'll use the form.
Deciding what to do: I don't know what to do next. I open the form, list options
in and decide what to do.
Noticing aversion: I feel averse to doing something. I open the form, write down
what I'm averse to and why, and what to do about it.
Planning a task: I don't know how to go about doing something. I open the form,
make a plan for the thing, and decide on the next step.
One of the main reasons is that it allows me to fully switch tasks from eg. 'trying to do
something' to 'planning how to do it'. If I don't switch tasks properly I can end up half-
heartedly trying to do something whilst having a vague feeling that there's a better
way of doing it. Also, just having the form makes me more likely to 'go meta' and think
strategically about what I'm doing.
Task Inbox
I use a form as my capture method a la Getting Things Done - basically a method to
capture anything that I might want to do at some point. Once it's captured in the form,
I know that I'll review this later, and so don't need to worry about it until then. Forms
are fast, which feels important for my willingness to use the capture system.
Time Tracking
I use a form to track my time and prefer this to time tracking software like toggl and
clockify. The main reason is that forms are easy to customise. In the past I've

experimented with writing out a plan for each block of work time, and retrospectively
rating my productivity after completing a block. I've found this much easier to
implement in a form.
Why I Like Forms
I use forms in cases where I want to either capture information, or go through a
speciﬁc thought process, and where it's important for me to be able to do this quickly
and at low cost. I think forms are a great for this because:
1. They make good habit-actions. Opening a form is a concrete action which is
easy to make into a habit. For example, with the meta form, it feels a lot easier to
create a habit of [if I notice I don't know what to do -> press cmd + 2 (to open the
form)] than [if I notice I don't know what to do -> work out what to do].
2. They are fast. Forms are quick to load and open which is particularly useful for
processes that I do often (eg. task inbox) or sometimes feel reluctant to do (eg. diary).
To make opening them fast I create a chrome shortcut and create a hotkey (this
process for windows or using Alfred for mac). Having hotkeys is really useful.
3. They add structure. Forms give structure to the information you add or the
thinking you do. In the 'Meta' form I separate out input boxes for 'Thinking' and 'Next
Step'. This separation forces me to decide on a next step, which feels useful and
something I might not do otherwise.
4. They are clean. They only accept input, but don't show past input in the form
itself (unlike eg. google docs where you can see the stuﬀ you've previously written in
the same place that you add more stuﬀ, which I ﬁnd can be distracting).
5. They are customisable. It's easy to modify the forms and experiment with the
structure (eg. incorporating retrospective ratings into time tracking).
More Forms
CBT Form
This is a form to practice a simpliﬁed cognitive behavioural therapy process. I used to
use this for noticing and processing negative emotions and thoughts. The boxes
include:
What is the objective situation I'm responding to?
What thoughts and feelings am I having?
Are these reasonable?
Planning Social Interactions
I ﬁnd it useful to make a quick plan for social interactions that I'm having eg. hanging
out with a friend. For example, asking myself 'What would be fun to do together?' and

'What would be interesting to talk about?'. It's also nice having a record of the
socialising I've been doing.
More
Ideas Form: Capturing ideas I've had that I want to think about more later.
Article/ Book Notes Form: The low barrier to taking notes makes me do it
more than if I'm taking notes in a doc.
Predictions Form: Again, having a low barrier makes me do this more often. I
have this set up so that I automatically get an email reminder when I expect the
prediction to have been resolved.
Habit Tracker and Diary Forms: Tracking daily habits and doing a daily self-
reﬂection.
Forms Form: Recording ideas for more forms, my favourite platonic forms and
whether I'm on form.

Delegate a Forecast
This is a linkpost for
https://forum.eﬀectivealtruism.org/posts/GKnXGiobbg5PFikzJ/delegate-a-forecast
EDIT: We've stopped answering questions for now, sorry if we didn't get to your
question! We're still really interested in what kinds of questions people want
forecasted, feedback on how useful it is to delegate forecasts, and Elicit as a tool, so
feel free to keep commenting these thoughts. We also forecasted questions on the EA
Forum version of this post.
Hi everyone! We, Ought, have been working on Elicit, a tool to express beliefs in
probability distributions. This is an extension of our previous work on delegating
reasoning. We're experimenting with breaking down the reasoning process in
forecasting into smaller steps and building tools that support and automate these
steps.
In this speciﬁc post, we're exploring the dynamics of Q&A with distributions by
oﬀering to make a forecast for a question you want answered. Our goal is to
learn:
1. Whether people would appreciate delegating predictions to a third party, and
what types of predictions they want to delegate
2. Whether a distribution can more eﬃciently convey information (or convey
diﬀerent types of information) than text-based interactions
3. Whether conversing in distributions isolates disagreements or assumptions that
may be obscured in text
4. How to translate the questions people care about or think about naturally into
more precise distributions (and what gets lost in that translation)
We also think that making forecasts is quite fun. In that spirit, you can ask us (mainly
Amanda Ngo and Eli Liﬂand) to forecast any continuous question that you want
answered. Just make a comment on this post with a question, and we'll make a
distribution to answer it.
Some examples of questions you could ask:
When will I be able to trust a virtual personal assistant to make important
decisions for me?
I live in the US. How much happier will I be if I move to Germany?
How many EA organizations will be founded in 2021?
I live in New York. When will I be able to go to the gym again?
In 2021, what percentage of my working hours will I spend on things that I would
consider to be forecasting or forecasting-adjacent?
We'll spend <=1 hour on each one, so you should expect about that much rigor and
information density. If there's context on you or the question that we won't be able to
ﬁnd online, you can include it in the comment to help us out.
We'll answer as many questions as we can from now until Monday 8/3. We expect to
spend about 10-15 hours on this, so we may not get to all the questions. We'll post
our distributions in the comments below. If you disagree or think we missed
something, you can respond with your own distribution for the question.

We'd love to hear people's thoughts and feedback on outsourcing forecasts, providing
beliefs in probability distribution, or Elicit generally as a tool. If you're interested in
more of what we're working on, you can also check out the competition we're
currently running on LessWrong to amplify Rohin Shah's forecast on when the majority
of AGI researchers will agree with safety concerns.

Quantifying Household Transmission
of COVID-19
Overview
If someone in your household gets COVID-19, how likely are you to get infected? Is it
possible to reduce this risk with interventions? How much of all transmission is
between members of the same household? Is household transmission less bad
because infections in the household don't spread to the outside?
We (Mihaela Curmei, Andrew Illyas, Jacob Steinhardt and Owain Evans) wrote an
academic paper on these questions. Owain made an informal slide show with the
same material. The full version (34 slides) is here, and this LW post contains some
highlights.
Key Results
We show how to adjust previous estimates of household transmission to correct for
inaccurate testing and selection bias. We pool existing data using a Bayesian meta-
analysis and estimate the chance of being infected by an infected household member
as 30% (95% CI 18%-43%). This probability is heterogeneous across studies, with a
standard deviation of 15% (9%-27%). Household transmission was likely a small
fraction of transmission before social distancing (5%-35%) but a large fraction
(30%-55%) after. Our results and observational studies suggest household
transmission can be reduced with behavioral interventions. It is uncertain how much
infections in households spread to the outside, but we show this is related to the
eﬀectiveness of contact tracing.
Highlights from Slide Show

We consider two main ways of quantifying household transmission. The ﬁrst is the
intra-household eﬀective reproductive number Rh. This is deﬁned by decomposing the
familiar R number (the eﬀective reproductive number) into a sum of community and
intra-household reproductive numbers. These reproductive numbers will change over
time due to behavioral interventions and reduced susceptibility. Second is the
household SAR. The SAR varies depending on the age of i and j and the relationship
(spouses vs housemates). For our purposes, the SAR is an average over the rates for
diﬀerent groups.

This diagram illustrates R, Rh, and SAR. At time t, there is a set of primary cases who
are infected. They each have a set of contacts and some of those become infected at
time t+1. Infected contacts are shown in red. Household members of primary cases
have a blue box around them. The topmost primary case has two household members
and infects 1/3 of them. The middle primary case has one household member and
doesn't infect them, and the bottom primary case has no household members. To
compute Rh, we look at the red nodes in blue boxes (positive cases) and do not
consider negative cases. Here Rh=1/3. To compute the SAR we look at the ratio of red
to white nodes in blue boxes. Here SAR =1/4.

The empirical studies of SAR are based on government contact tracing data. They
found primary cases based on symptoms or travel history and PCR testing and then
investigated whether their household members were infected.
The studies aren't as rigorous as we would hope. Some studies didn't test
asymptomatic household members and all studies used tests (RT-PCR) that have a
high false-negative rate. However, some sources of bias can be adjusted for
statistically.
PCR testing has a high false-negative rate (or low sensitivity). These graphs come
from Kucirka et al [7]. We see that on the ﬁrst few days after being infected, someone
was unlikely to test positive. During the 10 days after typical symptom onset (Days 5-

15) the mean false-negative rate is still more than 17% (with diﬀerent papers giving
diﬀerent estimates [8]).
PSA: The false-negative rate for PCR tests may be lower (or higher) in your local test
center. However, these graphs are based on results mainly from China in Spring, and
this is where most of our SAR data comes from.
We did a Bayesian meta-analysis of the nine SAR studies [1], [3], [4], [9]-[14]. The
model corrects the original estimates of SAR for false negatives (for all studies) and
for the failure to test asymptomatics (in some studies). In the model, the household
SAR for study i is generated from a Beta distribution with a ﬂat (improper) prior on its
parameters. The precise false-negative rate FNRi and asymptomatic rate AR are
unknown and so we sample them from priors based on existing estimates. This model
allows us to estimate heterogeneity in SAR across studies and to pool data.

The results show that correcting for false negatives and asymptomatics has a
substantial eﬀect: the mean SAR estimate increased from 20% to 30% (second to last
row). It's also clear that SAR is heterogeneous across studies, with some 95% credible
intervals not overlapping. Part of this heterogeneity is likely due to false negatives and
asymptomatics (which we model but do not observe for each study). Another source
of heterogeneity is the actions taken by households in diﬀerent locations. There is
evidence that early isolation of symptomatic family members and PPE used at home
can reduce SAR.
Our results are quite uncertain. The 95% credible interval around the mean for the
SAR distribution is 18%-43%. Having a better estimate for the prior on false-negative
rates and the asymptomatic rate would lead to more accurate estimates of SAR. We
do not adjust for lack of asymptomatics among primary cases. My guess is that

asymptomatics are under-sampled and that they are less infectious. (At the same
time, their lack of symptoms means that household members will not take any
precautions). Adjusting for lack of asymptomatics will revise the SAR estimate down,
but probably not by a large amount. Future work (drawing on better studies on false-
negatives, asymptomatics, NPIs that reduce SAR) could put all these together and
more accurately model the SAR.
You might be concerned that the studies from China, South Korea and Taiwan are not
representative of the rest of the world. Maybe the SAR in these countries is lower than
in Europe or the US. Another issue (raised above) is the lack of asymptomatics among
primary or secondary cases. We address both of these issues using data from
European studies (in Germany and Italy) that did random population testing. We
ﬁnd that results are broadly consistent with the SAR estimates derived from East
Asian studies. See the full slide show for details.
We can compare our estimate for the household SAR of SARS-CoV-2 to other related
viruses. The SAR is correlated with the reproductive number R0. The R0 numbers are
taken from Wikipedia. SAR estimates taken from these papers. I didn't do a detailed
survey of other diseases and the issues of heterogeneity, selection bias and imperfect
testing probably distort the estimate of other diseases too. (I only found one study
involving deliberate infection to measure SAR.)

We don't have data on Rh for US states, but we approximate it using the value 
Rh = 0.3 pre-lockdown based on our earlier results. The main result here is that Rh is a
small fraction of R before lockdown but 25-60% of R during lockdown.
Our results show that SAR varies a lot between experiments. Some of this variation is
probably explained by NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) taken by households
to reduce transmission. However, for most studies we don't have information about
NPIs. There are two exceptions. Both are observational studies with fairly small n, and
so this is not watertight evidence. Each study suggests that avoiding contact with the
primary case and using standard NPIs (masks and disinfectant cleaning of surfaces)

reduce the SAR. We think it's likely that other standard NPIs also reduce SAR:
e.g. having close contact outdoors vs indoors, hand hygiene, and so on.
For more, read the paper or the full version of the slide show.

Praise of some popular LW articles
            My composition teacher in college told me that in some pottery schools, 
the teacher holds up your pot, examines it, comments on it, and then smashes it on 
the floor. They do this for your first 100 pots. 
 
In that spirit, this post's epistemic status is SMASH THIS POT. 
          
In line with my previous experiment in reading LW articles with a critical attitude,
focusing on the weakest passages, I decided to try the opposite. I picked two popular
LW articles suggested at the top of my feed, selected the passages I thought were
strongest, and tried to express my agreement and build on them.
 
Strongest Passage in "Reason Isn't Magic"
by Benquo
Quote 1
[Manioc transplantation to Africa] is oﬀered as a cautionary tale against
innovating through reason, since there's a lot of information embedded in your
culture (via hundreds of years of selection), even if people can't explain why...
First of all, it's not clear things got worse on net, just that a tradeoﬀ was made.
How many person-days per year were freed up by less labor-intensive manioc
handling? Has anyone bothered to count the hours lost to laborious traditional
manioc-processing, to compare them with the burden of consuming too much
cyanide?
The concept of "cultural selection" implies that the survival of weird, costly traditions
indicates that they must make a culture more ﬁt, so breaking them is likely to make a
culture worse oﬀ. Benquo is rightly skeptical of this little-tested idea.
What about slack, the idea that net negative traits might survive because competition
isn't ﬁerce enough to wipe them out?
What about the idea that weird, costly rules might improve group cohesion enough to
have a net positive eﬀect on cultural ﬁtness, even though their direct eﬀect is
negative?
What if ﬁtness tradeoﬀs diﬀer in diﬀerent environments, time periods, or cultural
contexts? Maybe simpler preparation produced higher cultural ﬁtness in Africa, while
the avoidance of cyanide poisoning produced higher cultural ﬁtness in South America.
What if  "reason" is being used inappropriately here to lump together any change
made based on individual thought? Didn't cultures throughout history and around the
world develop traditions for how to employ reason to produce good results?
Quote 2

Third, the actually existing Portuguese and Africans involved in this experiment
weren't committed rationalists - they were just people trying to get by. 
That's true, and I'd also point out that being a "committed rationalist" can mean not
only an individual striving for better reasoning, but a set of traditions and institutions
that shape and improve individual thought. The Portuguese and Africans certainly had
traditions of this kind, though perhaps not yet developed enough to avoid manioc
poisoning.
Benquo is right to point out that insofar as tradition and reason stand in opposition,
we should compare the ideal to the ideal and the actual to the actual. I'd build on that
and say that tradition and reason often harmonize, and that if the cultural evolution
hypothesis is correct, we should expect that over time, cultures that bring tradition
and reason into better harmony should win out.
Impact on conclusion:
The problem with this argument [about manioc exemplifying the dangers of
innovating through reason] is that it's a nonsense comparison... If this is the best
we can do for how poorly reason can perform, reason seems pretty great... 
There's absolutely no reason to think that the sort of gradual iteration that
accretes into tradition never enters a bad positive feedback loop. Even if you think
modernity is an exceptional case of that kind of bad feedback loop, we had to
have gotten there via the accretion of premodern tradition and iteration!
The only way out is through. But why did we have this exaggerated idea of what
reason could do, in the ﬁrst place?
Benquo argues that the manioc story wildly distorts the relative beneﬁts and dangers
of reason and tradition. This is true, but implicitly accepts the tradition vs. reason
dichotomy that I ﬁnd misguided. There are obvious ways in which tradition can serve
to shape and promote innovation overall, even if they appear to slow it down in the
short term.
The debate has political undercurrents. Why the urgency to defend reason or tradition
when the conceptual architecture is so hazy, unless there's some coded signalling
going on? Maybe this whole thing is being taken as a metaphor for the risk of an AI
singularity?
Strongest Passage in "It's okay to be (at least a little) irrational"
by Kaj Sotala
If, on the other hand, the community makes it clear that it's okay to be irrational,
for as long as you're trying to get rid of that, then you can actually become more
rational. You don't need to rationalize reasons why you're not being irrational, you
can accept that you are irrational and then change it.
School wants students who are hard workers with genuine curiosity, who don't just
want to get an A but really want to learn. This year, I've allowed myself to optimize for
ease and good grades, and to admit that I'm not curious about everything. This has
been important for clarifying my priorities and making time for real learning.

I'd build on this and say that it's easy for a community to be mistaken about its own
aims. Teachers, students, and administrators think school is about learning, but it
might be mostly about credentialism. The less pressure there is for participants to
signal the ostensible ideals, the more free they are to uncover the real purposes of the
institution they're participating in and navigate it or improve it.
What are other institutions that might beneﬁt from less pressure to meet the ideal?
Would we endorse the following statements?
In a relationship, it's okay to be loveless, for as long as you're trying to get rid of
that, then you can actually become more loving.
In a job, it's okay to be lazy, for as long as you're trying to get rid of that, then
you can actually become hardworking.
As a parent, it's okay to be authoritarian, for as long as you're trying to get rid of
that, then you can actually become more liberal with your child.
In society, it's okay to be prejudiced, for as long as you're trying to get rid of
that, then you can actually become accepting.
In budgeting, it's okay to splurge, for as long as you're trying to get rid of that,
then you can actually become frugal.
I do feel a sense of pressure to meet all these ideals, and that the unrelenting
pressure often produces feelings of resentment, anxiety, confusion, and manipulation.
I might open a dialogue with some loved ones about this idea, and see what their
thoughts are.
Impact on conclusion:
And it's not just a community thing, it's also an individual thing. Don't simply
make it clear to others that some irrationality is okay: make it also clear for
yourself. It's okay to be irrational.
I'd build on Kaj's remarks by pointing out that if this acceptance is so clearly beneﬁcial
and superﬁcially accessible, then there might be some powerful forces getting in the
way of it. In general, it's a nice idea, but I cringe when I imagine having a conversation
about the relaxing of speciﬁc ideals. "Hey honey, is it OK that I don't love you all the
time?" "Sure, babe, as long as you're trying to love me!"
Maybe what Eliezer accomplished in the post that inspired Kaj is that he found a way
for Kaj's particular form of irrationality to be interpreted as a signal of rationality. What
strategy would that imply for dealing with pressures to be loving, hardworking, liberal,
accepting, and frugal?
In a relationship, perhaps you'd ﬁnd a way to frame time apart as a way to regenerate
energy for reconnecting with them later. Taking time for myself is how I get ready to
love you better.
In a job, you might speak to the diﬃculties of the work you're doing. Tell your boss
how diﬃcult the job is, but then emphasize how much eﬀort you put into it, and the
good sense of humor you have about it. Me being tired and jaded only illustrates what
a good work ethic I must have to be showing up for this job.
As a parent, you might have a frank conversation with your kid, telling them that
when they provoke you, it stresses you out and makes you more likely to be snappish
and controlling. Me admitting my controlling tendencies is the ﬁrst step toward a more
open relationship with my child.

Dealing with prejudice, you might use a prejudiced mutual acquaintance as an
example. Ask whether they might be able to let go of their prejudice if they didn't feel
shamed for not having absorbed all the little details of how to signal non-prejudice.
Entertaining the idea that relaxing our condemnation of a hopeless bigot's prejudice,
so that it might diminish in the long term, implies that the same rule might apply to
our lesser infractions.
In budgeting, you might really play up the times when you do spend money. Make a
big, fun deal about when you spend money, really making sure to get the most
enjoyment out of it. Money is to help me enjoy things, and by budgeting well, I
empower myself to get more enjoyment out of my money.
Assessment:
Responding to Benquo's piece, I notice that committing to a mindset of praise still
gives you opportunities to think beyond the piece you're reading. Examples include
teasing out implications, adding further justiﬁcations for the author's argument, or
ﬁlling in the hidden context. It's also unsatisfying to prohibit any criticism. Sometimes,
the article you're reading points the right direction, but doesn't choose the best route.
A mindset of praise helps you acknowledge the former without getting so hung up on
the latter that you wind up writing it all oﬀ out of contrarianism.
After reading Kaj's piece, I also see that a praise mindset leads to the generation of
new ideas, activates my imagination, and makes the article much more meaningful. I
have ideas for things I want to talk about with my girlfriend tonight. An article that you
merely read is like carrying around an empty cup. To criticize it is to check it for leaks
and shatter it when you ﬁnd them, so that you're not tempted to put some precious
liquid in it. To praise it is to pour in liquid and see what it will hold.
If there is no method of "true thinking," only the production of praise and criticism,
then it seems that practice in both modes is the only way to get better at this game
we're playing.
On the other hand, perhaps "true thinking" is allowing yourself to have private
reactions both of criticism and praise, and then checking them against other people's
private reactions to see if they line up. None of the other commentators on Benquo's
piece made quite the points I did.
Eliezer responded to Kaj's post diﬀerently from me. Instead of asking for relief from
being policed, or trying to arrange a diminution of mutual policing, he took Kaj's post
as a reason to stop policing others quite so much. A cursory glance over the
comments makes it seem that most discussion was around whether it's true that the
pressure to be rational is counterproductive, whereas my approach was to try and
come up with lots of examples of where the idea might be true, in order to allow some
practical tests in my own life.
If "true thinking" is shown by having your own reactions line up with those of other
people, then this didn't happen. Maybe Benquo's and Kaj's posts weren't provocative
enough to generate enough comments? Maybe they were open enough that the
commentariat's thoughts were too diverse to converge on a particular reaction?
Maybe I or they were not doing "true thinking," but merely rationalizing our reaction of
praise or critique?
Or maybe a praise mindset tends to produce divergent reactions, while a critical
mindset tends to produce convergence? There are many diﬀerent things we could say

are right about the truest parts of any given argument, but the problems with the
most false parts of an argument will be speciﬁc and apparent to all.
One advantage of this approach to reading - committing either to a critical or praise
mindset, and selecting a speciﬁc passage that you believe is the truest or most false
portion of the argument - is that it acts as a commitment device. No automatic strong
reaction to the text? Keep searching until you ﬁnd one! Don't have something to say?
Find something. It's there to be found. I think both the critical and the praise
approaches are good techniques for activating your mind, your imagination, your
curiosity. I hope to see future articles generated using these techniques, to see how
they work out for other people.
Finally, I like this format of responding to multiple unrelated articles in a single post. It
smashes together two ideas that you might not ordinarily think to consider together. It
makes for a more generative conversation, when I don't normally post comments on
old articles. It also allows me to generate enough content for a blog post, when my
reaction to a single article might not be suﬃcient.

Noise on the Channel
Articulation of these ideas in their present form owes a debt to interactions with Tsvi
Benson-Tilsen, and Erin Tatum.
Almost everyone will be familiar with the concept of signal vs noise. Literally, it's a
signal processing concept which diﬀerentiates useful information which we're trying to
communicate from useless distractor information which can corrupt our signal. Those
who grew up in a pre-digital age will be familiar with "static" on the telephone line or
TV. Digital information can be transmitted almost error-free through a noisy channel
via redundant encodings which allow error-correction, at a rate determined by
Shannon's noisy-channel coding theorem. This is a likely reason for the level of
redundancy in natural language, as well: it aids communication in a (literally) noisy
environment.
Metaphorically, we use the concept of signal vs noise to talk about everything from
inboxes and newsfeeds to writing styles. To this end, people talk about the signal-to-
noise-ratio: the proportion of useful/desirable information to total information in a
given information source. This is useful in part because it helps manage attention: the
total amount of useful information on (say) Twitter might be very large, but because of
a very low signal-to-noise ratio, it may not be an eﬃcient way to get information. In
contrast to the technical signal-processing model, where the sender and receiver
share a concept of which information is useful, this metaphorical generalization
admits that the sender's "signal" might be the receiver's "noise".
I'm here to talk about a further metaphorical extension of the signal/noise concept. I
don't know whether this concept is especially useful, but it's very strongly a part of my
personal experience -- this is one of the most salient aspects of a conversation for me,
and one of the biggest factors in determining how enjoyable or productive a
conversation is. I call it "fuzz" or "static" or "noise on the channel".
EDIT: Jimmy rightly points out that the concept I'm pointing at is more like "the
opposite of bandwidth" (ie, I'm describing the way a low-bandwidth channel warps
conversations). Noise makes for low eﬀective bandwidth due to the above-mentioned
noisy-channel coding theorem. So it makes sense that the two have very similar
eﬀects on conversations.
How much static is in this
conversation?
I'm pointing to a set of conditions which all have a similar way of making
conversations more diﬃcult and less fruitful.
Here are some examples of what I'm talking about.
1. Literally, a noisy room. A bar on a busy night; everyone is shouting in an eﬀort
to be heard over the loud music and the other people shouting. (Literal unironic
object-level question: why do so many people think this is a good social setting?
Maybe the noise serves an important social function I'm not seeing?) 2 One or
both people are hard of hearing. This is practically the same as a noisy room.

2. One or both of the participants are repeatedly distracted. Threads of inquiry
keep getting interrupted, and sometimes forgotten.
3. You are talking to someone who has to leave in a minute. You both know you
don't have time to get into any complicated topics.
4. One or both participants lack ﬂuency in their common language. Otherwise
simple things may take minutes to get across, much like a game of charades or
person-do-thing. Complex subjects cannot be discussed, unless the conversation
is very low-noise in other relevant aspects (IE, the participants are committed
and have a lot of time).
5. One or both people lack interest in the discussion. Like the example where
someone needs to leave soon, it's likely that you don't have a lot of time,
because a disinterested person may break oﬀ the conversation early. Like the
example where there are constant distractions, it's likely that you don't have full
attention, and points may get cut oﬀ or dropped.
6. There is a high inferential distance. The conversation participants have very
diﬀerent ways of thinking about the subject at hand, which have been developed
over long time periods and have a lot of details. Even when the language
appears to be shared, there may be hidden diﬀerences which are actually critical
(see the double illusion of transparency). Like the case of lacking ﬂuency, this
means both speakers need to spend a lot of time carefully conveying concepts
and checking whether they're understood.
7. There are a lot of conversational land-mines. Secrets which need to be kept, or
touchy subjects which can't be brought up. You need to tread very carefully to
avoid blowing up.
In all of these situations, I experience a very similar stressful feeling. I'm trying to
squeeze my ideas through a tiny straw. Often the ideas stay bottled up, because it's
impossible to communicate complex thoughts. One of the main things I want to get
across in this post is my model of why communication is so terrible in these situations.
Why Noise Sucks So Much
All of the object-level diﬃculties I listed in the previous conversation are diﬀerent.
However, I think the main source of diﬃculty in such conversations is often the Nth-
order eﬀects the "noise" has on the conversation, which are very similar. Many
diﬀerent obstacles to good conversation cause each other and compound on each
other to make for a sucky conversation.
In a noisy room,
I have to shout to be heard.
Shouting takes eﬀort, which makes me a little more reluctant to speak.
I'm not sure if I will be heard, which makes the expected value of speaking lower.
I'm not sure whether I was heard, which means I'm not sure I can build on my
previous statements.
It's diﬃcult to hear the other person, which means I have to ﬁll in the gaps,
making assumptions about what they probably said.
The same is true for them, meaning I have to worry about whether I was really
understood.
The need to make additional statements to check whether I've understood what
they said multiplies with the extra eﬀort of shouting.

Even if we largely are being understood, the constant worry that we aren't still
makes it more diﬃcult to build on previous points in the discussion.
All of the above combines to lower the expected value of the conversation.
Because both of us know these things lower the expected value of conversation,
we both have less faith in each other's commitment to the conversation.
Even if we are both fairly committed to the conversation, our lack of faith in the
other person's commitment means we have to treat them like a possibly
distracted/disinterested person. This lowers the expectations for the
conversation even further, recursively compounding the eﬀect.
This worry that the other person isn't going to be very committed to a good
conversation means we can't even expect lengthy error-checking procedures to
enable us to get complex points across, because we don't know whether the
other person will be motivated enough to participate in correcting errors or
verifying that points were understood.
All of the above means that we are restricted to things which (1) can be
communicated fairly quickly, and (2) are commonplace enough that the other
party is likely to guess our meaning correctly despite all the communication
diﬃculties. Basically, small talk. This restriction in feasible subject matter further
drops the expected value of the conversation, further compounding other
eﬀects.
Since both people probably realize that the feasible subject matter of
conversation is restricted, this knowledge plays into the guesswork we do when
trying to ﬁgure out what the other person meant / check whether we heard them
correctly. This fact itself further reinforces the restriction of subject matter, since
it means we'll be even more likely to be misunderstood if we say something
complicated.
I could go on. The point is that the bad eﬀects compound each other. A noisy
conversation involves a heavy game-theoretic component. Each participant's
expectations of the value of the conversation is heavily dependent on (their estimate
of) each other's expectations. There's a stag hunt for a good conversation, but the
cost of hunting stag is being driven up, without driving up the reward. This means
people are even more likely to hunt rabbit than usual, even if hunting stag would still
be the overall better option. (And the perception that people are more likely to hunt
rabbit makes it even more likely, which feeds back in... well you get the idea.)
You might think you're not doing all the metacognition which I describe above; or, that
"normal people" don't do that much metacognition. And maybe not. But I don't think
you actually have to do the metacognition in order to feel the consequences. A
simpler reinforcement-learning like algorithm will still teach you, via conditioning, that
you can't expect deep conversations in certain contexts. As people learn that, they'll
try less, and teach each other even more that it's not going to work. So without even
thinking about all the recursive implications of the noisy environment, you might have
a general sense of doom about diﬃcult conversations in noisy environments. If you're
like me, that sense of doom will also pervade a wide variety of similar situations which
aren't literally noisy, but share critical features in common with noise.
The Wonderful Magic of Noise-Free
Conversations

I still expect some readers to not really know what I'm talking about. Those readers
may not even know that they don't know what I'm talking about. Noise is pervasive. A
truly low-noise conversation is a rare and precious thing. It's like falling in love. It's like
an old friend who understands you. It's Deep Work. It's the joy of being seen and
being understood. You don't know what you're missing until you've experienced it.
Of course, this is all a matter of degree. There's the simple everyday variation in
"noise" which comes from distracted vs undistracted time, close friends vs
acquaintances, et cetera. Then there's the rare, really deep conversations which
happen when two people are really very interested in understanding each other,
repeatedly make time for each other, and work together to eliminate distractions and
other barriers. And then there are the as-yet-undreamt-of heights of noise-free
conversations which can only be attained by black-belt rationalists who have ﬁrst
internalized and then later transcended all kinds of cognitive skills related to good
conversation, after ingesting all the right nootropics and heading to an extended
wilderness retreat.
Let's reverse some of the previous points I made, to clarify what a really low-noise
conversation looks like:
Low literal noise. Everyone's literal words are understood easily. Everyone knows
this without hesitation, so it fades into the background and doesn't take any
attention.
No distractions. Everyone has a clear mind to focus entirely on the discussion.
Again, everyone knows this and doesn't have to think about it.
High level of interest. It's common knowledge that everyone in the conversation
wants to continue engaging in the conversation, and is interested in
understanding what others have to say. There is a high expectation of follow-
through on lines of thinking, even if those lines of thinking are very tricky and
subtle and will take a lot of time to follow through.
Relatedly, large time commitment. The conversation has all the time it needs. If
the conversation eventually has to end on this particular day, there is a high
degree of trust that you'll get together again soon to continue it, and do so
repeatedly for as long as the subject requires it. There is no end in sight.
Points are never dropped unless everyone thinks they're ﬁnished. In the ideal,
there is perfect memory of the conversation, everyone readily knows what the
open points are, and those points get returned to in an expedient manner. (Of
course in reality, diﬀerent points have to compete for time.) Conclusions of the
conversation are fully internalized by all participants, and applied in any relevant
contexts which come up later (in this conversation or beyond). One example of a
helpful tool is a shared space for notes like a whiteboard, on which important
points get written.
There is a large shared context of understanding. Complicated concepts,
feelings, and intuitions which would normally be obscure are easily conveyed
and understood, due to special shared language which the participants have
developed for their needs in this conversation.
You can say anything that's on your mind. There are no conversational
landmines, no secrets, no taboos. Nor is anything considered oﬀ-topic; since
there is a strong shared interest in the subject matter and a high degree of trust
in that mutual interest, there is no need to police the conversation to avoid
distractions. Nor would there be any need even if not for that, due to the large
amount of time available, and the infallible memory everyone has for the active
points of discussion. All of this means that when you start on a seemingly
irrelevant branch of discussion, no one tries to reel you in; nor will they blame

you if it ultimately turns out to be irrelevant. Nonetheless, everyone does largely
stay on-topic.
Despite my praise for low-noise conversations, it bears mentioning that this isn't the
optimal kind of conversation to have for all purposes. Relaxed, distracted
conversations can be great for getting to know someone -- e.g., a highly distracted
conversation over a board game. Some subjects demand fast, time-limited
conversations. Not all subjects of conversation merit a high level of interest; boredom
is sometimes the correct response. And so on.
It's also sometimes possible to get really good conversations by dramatically lowering
some kinds of "noise" despite other types being very high. For example, a
conversation with high inferential distance is likely to have a lot of really valuable
information, if you can give it the time and attention to bridge the gap. Another
example: email conversations are likely to be slower and lower-commitment, but this
can be compensated for by the fact that all points are remembered (everything is in a
text record) and participants can take a lot of time to compose their thoughts. (Keep
in mind that the probability you'll write a thoughtful reply inﬂuences the amount of
eﬀort the other party will put into their email.)
Dealing with Noise
Sometimes you just have to make due with a noisy conversation. In that case, it pays
to have some coping strategies.
Lower your epistemic standards. Sad to say, you may be faced with the choice
between communicating something poorly and not communicating it at all. In some
cases, communicating it poorly will be preferable. I wouldn't recommend practicing
this as a skill so much as trying to notice that you already do it -- better, at least, to
explicitly ﬂag for yourself that you're less than totally accurate. Some examples:
Guess at what the other person means, rather than seeking clariﬁcation. You
don't have time/energy/etc to get clariﬁcation. Fly by the seat of your pants in
this conversation. Just make a guess and go with it.
Settle for communicating something in the right cluster. Maybe there isn't
bandwidth in the conversation to tell them what you were really up to yesterday,
even though they asked. Maybe "working" is a lie for subtle reasons. You weren't
really working. But it gives them approximately the right idea.
Pick the most important point, and drop the rest. The conversation doesn't
have the attention for everything right now; you just have to make a choice.
Accept being unheard or misunderstood. Maybe you were feeling kind of oﬀ
about something that happened yesterday and you wanted a sympathetic ear to talk
it out with. Oh well. This conversation isn't the one where that's going to happen. Let's
talk about the weather or something instead.
Am I the Noisy One?
On the other hand, you could be doing any of the above things unnecessarily, creating
a "noisy" conversation despite the lack of a noisy environment. Like I said, a good

conversation is a stag hunt. Are you hunting rabbit unnecessarily? Are you ignoring
your conversation partner's attempts to hunt stag? Are you not giving them the
opportunity to try?
I suspect this can be easy to miss if you don't have a lot of experience with the deeper
sort of conversation which (unknown to you) your conversation partner is trying to
have. Imagine an angsty teenager who assumes any genuine conversation about
feelings is a setup for making fun of them. Or imagine someone just starting as a
graduate student, who doesn't have any experience with pre-rigorous research
concepts turning into rigorous concepts later, so blocks themself oﬀ from engaging
with ideas that don't sound rigorous (because they're trying to be a serious
researcher).
If you notice yourself engaging in some of the "dealing with noise" strategies from the
previous section: are you hunting rabbit when others were trying to hunt stag?
Credibly Committing to Continuing
Conversation
If approaching this as a problem to be solved, rather than just a phenomenon to be
aware of, one approach is to visibly set time aside, set aside distractions, and give a
conversation your full attention. Remove distractions: set aside phone, laptop, etc.
Find a private room or a semi-isolated outdoor location. Perhaps take the conversation
on a long walk without a cell phone, which provides a visible commitment to keep
talking for some amount of time. If you want to make sure there are follow-up
conversations, maybe mention that early on, to establish common knowledge that this
is only the ﬁrst part of a continuing conversation.
Again, this isn't a guide to how every conversation should ideally go. Not every
conversation deserves your maximal attention. And the Schelling choice is rabbit, not
stag.
Maybe it's possible to 80/20 this. Perhaps it's possible to be someone who has deep
conversations even if they're brief and have no certainty of being continued later.
Maybe you can get a lot of the beneﬁt by merely giving oﬀ the feeling that you might,
if only you had more time, listen and participate deeply in the conversation. Maybe
you can ﬁnd a way to get away with reversing some or all of the advice I gave in
"Dealing with Noise" -- raise your epistemic expectations, remember all the points,
don't accept being unheard or misunderstood. Just give oﬀ an aura of reasonableness
except instead of making people avoid dramatic expressions of emotion, it makes
them feel that you're willing to hunt stag in the conversation.
If so, let me know what the trick is.

Generalizing the Power-Seeking
Theorems
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than usual.
Previously: Seeking Power is Often Provably Instrumentally Convergent in MDPs.
Circa 2021, the above post was revamped to supersede this one, so I recommend just
reading that instead.
Thanks to Rohin Shah, Michael Dennis, Josh Turner, and Evan Hubinger for comments.
The original post contained proof sketches for non-IID reward function distributions. I think
the actual non-IID theorems look diﬀerent than I thought, and so I've removed the proof
sketches in the meantime.
It sure seems like gaining power over the environment is instrumentally convergent (optimal
for a wide range of agent goals). You can turn this into math and prove things about it. Given
some distribution over agent goals, we want to be able to formally describe how optimal
action tends to ﬂow through the future.
Does gaining money tend to be optimal? Avoiding shutdown? When? How do we know?
Optimal Farsighted Agents Tend to Seek Power proved that, when you distribute reward fairly
and evenly across states (IID), it's instrumentally convergent to gain access to lots of ﬁnal
states (which are absorbing, in that the agent keeps on experiencing the ﬁnal state). The
theorems apply when you don't discount the future (you're "inﬁnitely farsighted").

Most reward functions for the Pac-Man
game incentivize not dying immediately,
so that the agent can loop around higher-
scoring conﬁgurations. 
 

Many ways of scoring Tic-Tac-Toe game states incentivize not losing immediately,
in order to choose the highest-scoring ﬁnal conﬁguration. 
 
"All states have self-loops, left hidden to reduce clutter. 
In AI: A Modern Approach (3e), the agent starts at 1 and receives reward for
reaching 3. The optimal policy for this reward function avoids 2, and one might
suspect that avoiding 2 is instrumentally convergent. However, a skeptic might
provide a reward function for which navigating to 2 is optimal, and then argue
that "instrumental convergence'' is subjective and that there is no reasonable
basis for concluding that 2 is generally avoided.

We can do better... for any way of independently and identically distributing
reward over states, 
 of reward functions have farsighted optimal policies which
avoid 2. If we complicate the MDP with additional terminal states, this number
further approaches 1.
If we suppose that the agent will be forced into 2 unless it takes preventative
action, then preventative policies are optimal for 
 of farsighted agents - no
matter how complex the preventative action. Taking 2 to represent shutdown, we
see that avoiding shutdown is instrumentally convergent in any MDP representing
a real-world task and containing a shutdown state. We argue that this is a special
case of a more general phenomenon: optimal farsighted agents tend to seek
power."
~ Optimal Farsighted Agents Tend to Seek Power 
While it's good to understand the limiting case, what if the agent, you know, isn't inﬁnitely
farsighted? That's a pretty unrealistic assumption. Eventually, we want this theory to help us
predict what happens after we deploy RL agents with high-performing policies in the real
world. 
Normal amounts of sightedness

But what if we care about the journey? What if γ ∈(0, 1)? 
We can view Frank as traversing a Markov decision process, navigating between states with
his actions:

Reward is IID, so the gold-heap state doesn't have an intrinsically more generous
reward distribution than the castle-and-dragon state.
It sure seems like Frank is more likely to start with the blue or green gems. Those give him
way more choices along the way, after all. But the previous theorems only said "at γ = 0,
he's equally likely to pick each gem. At γ = 1, he's equally likely to end up in each terminal
state". 
Not helpful.
Let me tell you, ﬁnding the probability that one tangled web of choices is optimal over
another web, is generally a huge mess. You're ﬁnding the measure of reward functions which
satisfy some messy system of inequalities, like 

r 1 + γ 
  > max ( r 3 + 
  ( r 4 + γ r 5 ) , 
r 3 + γ 
  , 
  ) . 
And that's in the simple tiny environments! 
How do we reason about instrumental convergence - how do we ﬁnd those sets of
trajectories which are more likely to be optimal for a lot of reward functions? 
We exploit symmetries. 
There exists a graph isomorphism between this blue-gem-subgraph and the red-
gem-graph, such that the isomorphism leaves Frank where he is.
r 2
1 − γ
γ
1 − γ 2
r 5
1 − γ
r 3
1 − γ

The blue gem makes available all of the same options as the red gems, and then some.
Since the blue gem gives you strictly more options, it's strictly more likely to be optimal!
When you toss back in the green gem, avoiding the red gems becomes yet more likely. 
So, we can prove that for all γ ∈(0, 1), most agents don't choose the red gems. Agents are
more likely to pick blue than red. Easy. 
Plus, this reasoning mirrors why we think instrumental convergence exists to begin with:
Sure, the goal could incentivize immediately initiating shutdown procedures. But if you
stay active, you could still shut down later, plus there are all these other states the agent
might be incentivized to reach.  
This extends further. If the symmetry occurs twice over, then you can conclude the agent is
at least twice as likely to do the instrumentally convergent thing.  
Relaxation summary
My initial work made a lot of simplifying assumptions:
The agents are inﬁnitely farsighted: they care about average reward over time, and
don't prioritize the present over the future.
Relaxed. See above.
The environment is deterministic.
Relaxed. The paper is already updated to handle stochastic environments. The
new techniques in this post also generalize straightforwardly.
Reward is distributed IID over states, where each state's reward distribution is bounded
and continuous.
The environment is Markov.
Relaxed. n-step Markovian environments are handled by conversion into
isomorphic Markov environments.
The agent is optimal.
The environment is ﬁnite and fully observable.
The power-seeking theorems apply to: inﬁnitely farsighted optimal policies in ﬁnite
deterministic MDPs with respect to reward distributed independently, identically,
continuously, and boundedly over states.
Conclusion
We now have a few formally correct strategies for showing instrumental convergence, or lack
thereof. 
In deterministic environments, there's no instrumental convergence at γ = 0 for IID
reward.
When 0 < γ < 1, you're strictly more likely to navigate to parts of the future which give
you strictly more options (in a graph-theoretic sense). Plus, these parts of the future
give you strictly more power.
When γ = 1, it's instrumentally convergent to access a wide range of terminal states.
This can be seen as a special case of having "strictly more options", but you no
longer require an isomorphism on the paths leading to the terminal states.

Appendix: Proofs
In the initial post, proof sketches were given. The proofs ended up being much more
involved than expected. Instead, see Theorem F.5 in Appendix F of Optimal Policies Tend to
Seek Power.

Goodreads, it has a rating of 4.07 from 1,968 reviews. "The book was selected by
Fortune as one of the 75 'Smartest Books of All Time.'", notes Wikipedia. So this
should be a great book. I forgot who wrote this, and I forgot the exact words, but I
remember reading on twitter that Taleb is something like a modern genius because in
his books he develops a worldview based on fundamental insights on randomness,
and derives important conclusions including a system of ethics from that. Now that
sounds promising! This worldview is developed in Taleb's Incerto series of ﬁve books.
In the description of the German publisher you can read that the order in which you
read the books does not matter, but then it seemed like a good idea to start with the
ﬁrst one nonetheless ("The Black Swan" surely is the better-known title and has 2,083
reviews).
The book seems to have been a revelation to many, judging by the enthusiastic
reviews. In a ﬁve-star Amazon review, reviewer Alex Bush writes (November 3, 2015)
that the book "revolutionized how I view the world. In multiple ways. It's hard to
overstate how rarely a book changes your ideas about how the world works once, let
alone multiple times". He thinks that Taleb "has managed to weave a fantastically
engaging and entertaining book out of what could very easily be a dry and technical
topic", that FbR is "the most general and therefore most widely applicable" book by
Taleb, and suggests that it teaches people "the survivorship and hindsight biases, as
well as the diﬀerence between conditional and unconditional probability". Indeed,
these are things you may learn from the book in a non-technical way. You may also
learn that people ﬁnd causality where there is mere randomness; that the past of a
time series can lead you to a false feeling of certainty if rare events are relevant; that
it is often disregarded that the expected value of a random distribution may diﬀer
from the median, when in fact it would be critical to keep it in mind if possible rare
events would have strongly negative eﬀects. These things come together when
people attribute a ﬁnancial trader's performance to his ability in selecting the right
stocks, their value increases over a long time, but he disregards that a crash of the
stockmarket may ruin him. So the fact that I did not ﬁnd the book so eye-opening may
be related to the fact that I already knew some things about statistics, probability,
econometrics and behavioral economics, that I had read Thinking Fast and Slow,
blogposts on Lesswrong, and some other things Taleb writes about. To be fair, the
book is from 2001, and maybe many concepts described in the book were very
innovative back then.
However, amazon reviewer Alex Bush also writes that "it's often hard to determine
whether the heart of the book is the ideas ... or the author. I can't stress how much I
learned from this book that has nothing to do with probability or statistics, just
random asides from an erudite and meandering mind." This may make you a bit
skeptical. 
And indeed, the author does meander. A common criticism in reviews is that the book
is way too long; suggestions are somewhere between a paragraph (which is a bit
mean), a New Yorker article and 50 pages. More importantly, the book lacks structure.
In the preface, Taleb writes that he "hates books that can be easily guessed from the
table of contents (not many people read textbooks for pleasure)". And so it is a bit

obscure what kind of book Taleb wants this to be. It seems he aims at being
illuminating and, at the same time, entertaining. The book contains many stories and
anecdotes, usually using a story about some person exemplifying a certain kind of
behavior, but it is sometimes unclear how representative these stories are.
If nothing else, you will certainly know a lot about Nassim Nicholas Taleb when you
have ﬁnished reading the book. He likes to go to the gym. He does not want to be a
janitor. He is intelligent and cultured, and people around him are ignorant and shallow
- people in the ﬁnancial industry and in the media in particular - and they usually do
not appreciate his insights when he explains them. As a cultured, intelligent person he
also admits some emotional weaknesses. You will also know the names of some
people whom Taleb likes and several people whom he dislikes. Maybe you read
somewhere that Taleb is arrogant and likes to start ﬁghts, but that he has profound
insights. (I had read something like that somewhere.) Well, I don't mind arrogance per
se, if it is just some topping on the cake of insight. What I ﬁnd a bit annoying,
however, is that some people (or at least some reviewers) seem to understand the
style of the book as a signal for the insight.
And indeed, Taleb's self-descriptions seem to aim at signaling some kind of insight.
This can be a bit lengthy. When Taleb writes that he had a lucky career choice, he
notes that "one of the attractive aspects of my profession as a quantitative option
trader is that I have close to 95% of my day free to think, read and research". As this
does not seem to be clear enough, he also adds: "(or 'reﬂect' in the gym, on ski
slopes, or, more eﬀectively, on a park bench)", and then: "I also had the privilege of
frequently 'working' from my well-equipped attic." Over the book, the self-descriptions
of Taleb, his descriptions of people around him, and many other digressions add up. In
a book whose topic is the problem that we often confuse noise with signal and should
be mindful of distinguishing them, this is a bit disturbing. Of course - reading about an
author's life can be interesting, and anecdotes can be illuminating; Daniel Kahneman's
writing is a good example of that. But the entertainment highly depends on an
author's style, and writing anecdotes in an illuminating way seemingly is not easy.
(Just to add one example: At some point, Taleb says that he sat in many meetings
where traders had to oﬀer their interpretations of what was currently moving the
markets. He says he found these meetings to be a waste of time. And he adds that he
himself talked a lot in them, to make them less boring, though he did not listen to
what other people had to say: "I have to confess that my optimal strategy (to soothe
my boredom and allergy to conﬁdent platitudes) was to speak as much as I could,
while totally avoiding listening to other people's replies by trying to solve equations in
my head. Speaking too much would help me clarify my mind, and, with a little bit of
luck, I would not be 'invited' back (i.e, forced to attend) the following week." It is up to
every reader to decide what the conﬁdent platitudes are at this point; but it is a little
weird that it does not seem to occur to Taleb that the other participants of these
meetings may have the same justiﬁcation for their "platitudes" and the same view of
themselves and the others.)
I stopped reading the book after chapter 9 (that is, after 202 paes of the German epub
edition, which is 302 pages long, excluding some back matter parts). At this point, the
book had improved, the last two chapters had been more readable and more
interesting, which might have made me continue reading. But then again, what had
these last chapters been about? Chapter 9 nicely illustrates the problem of regression
to the mean, and this served as a reminder to lower expectations. The expected value
of the rest of the book did not seem high enough.

Summing up
You may like the book if you need a story-based introduction to some biases in
understanding random events, and if you ﬁnd a certain joy in an author classifying
others as idiots.
(At several points, I think things that Taleb writes are wrong or misleading, but I will
not put time and eﬀort into arguing about these points.)
What did I like about the book?
There are nice illustrations about regression to the mean and survivor bias. Also, the
mentions of several ﬁnancial-market crises of the last decades served as a nice
reminder to put things into perspective.
What did I learn from the book?
The most interesting thing that the book emphasized to me was that it is often hard to
rate the quality of books using a single "quality" dimension. For a fair judgement, it
seems necessary to know the background of the typical reader, to know what the
author wants, and to understand the intellectual environment in which he wrote the
book. Fooled by Randomness may be a good book for someone to whom the
survivorship bias is news, it may transport Taleb's message, and it may have been
revolutionary 19 years ago.

How to Find Sources in an Unreliable
World
I spent a long time stalling on this post because I was framing the problem as "how to
choose a book (or paper. Whatever)?". The point of my project is to be able to get to
correct models even from bad starting places, and part of the reason for that goal is
that assessing a work often requires the same skills/knowledge you were hoping to
get from said work. You can't identify a good book in a ﬁeld until you've read several.
But improving your starting place does save time, so I should talk about how to
choose a starting place.
One diﬃculty is that this process is heavily adversarial. A lot of people want you to
believe a particular thing, and a larger set don't care what you believe as long as you
ﬁnd your truth via their amazon aﬃliate link (full disclosure: I use amazon aﬃliate
links on this blog). The latter group ﬁlls me with anger and sadness; at least the
people trying to convert you believe in something (maybe even the thing they're
trying to convince you of). The link farmers are just polluting the commons.
With those diﬃculties in mind, here are some heuristics for ﬁnding good starting
places.
Search "best book TOPIC" on google
Most of what you ﬁnd will be useless listicles. If you want to save time,
ignore everything on a dedicated recommendation site that isn't ﬁve
books.
If you want to evaluate a list, look for a list author with deep models on
both the problem they are trying to address, and why each book in
particular helps educate on that problem.  Examples:
Fivebooks' Best Books on Learning from the Great Depression
Fivebooks' Best Books on Evolution
A bad list will typically have a topic rather than a question they are trying
to answer, and will talk about why books they recommend are generically
good, rather than how they address a particular issue. Quoting consumer
reviews is an extremely bad sign and I've never seen it done without being
content farming.

Search for your topic on Google Scholar
Look at highly cited papers. Even if they're wrong, they're probably
important for understanding what else you read.
Look at what they cite or are cited by
Especially keep an eye out for review articles
Search for web forums on your topic (easy mode: just check reddit). Sometimes
these will have intro guides with recommendations, sometimes they will have
where-to-start posts, and sometimes you can ask them directly for
recommendations. Examples:
r/AskHistorians' Best books on the rise and fall of the Roman empire for a
layperson?
Quora's What is the best book to read up on the 1929 Great Depression?
Search Amazon for books on your topic. Check related books as well.

Ask your followers on social media. Better, announce what you are going to read
and wait for people to tell you why you are wrong (appreciate it, Ian). Admittedly
there's a lot of prep work that goes into having friends/a following that makes
this work, but it has a lot of other beneﬁts so if it sounds fun to you I do
recommend it. Example:
Dan Luu pointed me to Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography
when I stated that I'd never seen a list with >5 recommendations that was
any good.
Ask an expert. If you already know an expert, great. If you don't, this won't
necessarily save you any time, because you have to search for and assess the
quality of the expert.
Follow interesting people on social media and squirrel away their
recommendations as they make them, whether they're relevant to your current
projects or not.

What a 20-year-lead in military tech
might look like
I've spent way too much time speculating about near-future military
technology. Here is a list of technologies I think are likely to be important to
a conventional war in, say, 2040.
If you think this list shouldn't be taken seriously because I don't have oﬃcial
expertise, you are probably right. I think that if I became an expert I'd probably end
up deleting a third of the things on this list and adding a similar number of new things.
(I did run this draft past three people with relevant expertise, though!) I look forward
to critiques in the comments.
If you are wondering why these speculations are relevant to LessWrong...
well, it was requested, and also it's relevant to a point I want to make later about AI.
You see, the technologies on this list could probably be quickly achieved with the help
of advanced-but-not-godlike-AI. The gap between these technologies and present-day
military tech is an example of a "small" gap; a "merely" 20-year-by-human-standards
gap. So, for example, suppose some corporation or nation gets AI systems which are
good but not godlike at designing new technologies. They vastly speed up the process
but don't do anything human engineers couldn't do in 20 years. Or, suppose there are
lots of AI systems in the world but one faction has systems which are the equivalent of
20-years-by-human-standards ahead. In either case, I think, the gap would translate
to an extremely large advantage, possibly enough to enable a small group to take
over the world, conquistador-style.
(To be clear, while I do think AI takeover is probable, I think
persuasion/politics/ideology is by far the most likely method, not military/war.)
Better command-and-control capabilities
(incl. Cyber and intel)
Command & control technologies are very important. Wars are won or lost on the
basis of how well each side is able to observe, predict, plan, organize, and
outmaneuver the other. I think the advancements in command and control tech that
are likely to happen in the next 20 years are more important than everything else on
this list combined. In case this isn't obvious, I'll say a few things below by way of
justiﬁcation.
Long-ranged guided weaponry already makes it easy to blow up targets if you know
where they will be when your attack arrives. Winning is all about ﬁnding the enemy
before they ﬁnd you. Now more than ever, being able to quickly gather loads of
information and integrate it and communicate the resulting orders to your forces is
super important, as is being able to disrupt your enemies' attempts to do the same.
There's lots of room for new technologies in this space, or much more advanced
versions of already existing tech: Satellites, spy drones, advanced sensors of various
kinds, more robust communication networks (e.g. cloud computing), AI to integrate all
the data, draw some interesting conclusions, and instantly make some of the relevant

decisions. Already the US military collects way too much data for teams of human
analysts to examine, and anyhow human analysts take too much time. Better to have
a computer say "Odds of imminent attack in sector 7 have spiked to 11%" as soon it
notices some unusual patterns. (A version of this might be useful at the tactical level,
e.g. "The sniper who shot that bullet is probably in this window; the mortar shell was
probably ﬁred from the alley at coordinates XY.")
What would it look like to have a signiﬁcant advantage in C&C+intel+cyber tech? The
enemy would be swinging blind punches, ﬁring missiles at locations where your troops
aren't, or marching forwards in the hopes of making contact while your forces quietly
dodge around them or set up an ambush. Your aircraft would ﬂy low over their
country, slipping through gaps in air defenses exposed by your satellites, destroying
key nodes of communication and transport. In regions you occupy, insurgency would
be impossible, as everything that moves (at least in important regions) would be
tracked by your cameras. In regions the enemy occupies, your insurgents (probably
local allies supplied with weapons and guidance) would be a real threat. Meanwhile,
you might have all sorts of electronic spies in their network, due to superior cyber
capabilities. You might even be able to shut down some of their systems at crucial
moments.
Persuasion tools might also be possible. Propaganda is already a thing, but
personalized propaganda powered by big data and machine learning will be much
more potent. Moreover, it is useful in peacetime also, and useful to many non-military
actors, so it will be heavily invested in and rapidly developed. This is another reason
why having an advantage in this sort of tech will help suppress enemy insurgencies
(and supercharge your own). It might also help with "turning" key enemy personnel
(such as a captured leader, or even a leader you have communication access to via a
spy or hack or parlay). At the very least it will help keep your own troops' morale and
loyalty high, which has always been and still is extremely important.
Aimbots
Aimbots are guns that aim and ﬁre automatically. A simple version would be a camera
and computer hooked up to the trigger of an infantry riﬂe, such that the riﬂe ﬁres
when the computer calculates that the bullet would hit the target. The software
involved would be a bit of image recognition, maybe a bit of physics, etc. The user
would point the gun at the target and the bullet would ﬁre at precisely the right
moment, increasing accuracy while decreasing aiming time. These aimbots already
exist and are being tested by the US military.
A more complex version would have some way of pointing the gun. For example, a
canister of compressed gas as an under-barrel attachment, with multiple nozzles
pointing in diﬀerent directions. The computer selectively opens the nozzles for split-
seconds, emitting jets of gas that jerk the barrel in such a way as to line it up with the
target, at least momentarily, during which the computer ﬁres the bullet. Perhaps the
camera would also be connected to a cell phone screen, so that the soldier holding
the riﬂe can stick it out from behind a wall while his buddy looks through the camera
screen and clicks on targets.
Anyone who has played a ﬁrst-person shooter with an auto-aim hack or ability will
already think this is powerful. A riﬂe attachment that quickens your reaction times and
makes almost every shot hit? Amazing! However on a real battleﬁeld the eﬀect would
be much more powerful than it is in video games. Here is why:

The vast majority of bullets ﬁred in war are not aimed, but sprayed in the general
direction of the enemy. This is called "suppressing ﬁre;" it keeps the enemy pinned in
place and prevents them from shooting back at you. Suppressing ﬁre is mostly not a
phenomenon in video games because players don't die in real life if they get hit by a
single video game bullet. In fact in most games a single bullet doesn't even kill your
video-game character, and if your character does die he simply respawns. In real war,
however, suppressing ﬁre is the primary way to deal with enemy infantry. They are
usually in cover, so you can't just shoot them; however, you can suppress them, so
that your own forces have freedom to maneuver safely. Then, your own forces can
ﬂank the enemy position, or close with it and lob grenades, or whatever. Of course,
they'll be trying to prevent you from doing this by suppressing you; you "win the
ﬁreﬁght" when they are suppressed and you are not.
Now suppose that one side has aimbots on their riﬂes. They can now shoot their riﬂes
without poking their heads out of cover (the point-and-click method mentioned
above). This means they can provide suppressing ﬁre without endangering
themselves. This means you can't win the ﬁreﬁght against them, at least not in the
normal sense. Meanwhile, their shots are way more accurate, and their reaction speed
is instantaneous--meaning they don't have to spray bullets in your general direction,
they can just wait, silently, and shoot a single bullet at you when you poke your head
around the corner. The bullet will hit you before you can react to whatever it is you've
seen. What this means is that (1) your forces will be suppressed extremely quickly,
even if you outnumber the enemy and start shooting at them before they start
shooting at you, (2) you'll lose a few men before you realize what is happening and
hunker down, (3) their ammunition will last much longer because they make every
bullet count, and (4) after the enemy leaves you might still be suppressed because
you won't know when they are gone because you are afraid to look. (With ordinary
human-caused suppressing ﬁre, the shots are being sprayed at you and are unlikely to
hit, so if you are brave you can peek for a second at relatively small risk. Problem #4
can be solved to some extent by countermeasures like using your own cell phone or a
mirror to peek around the corner, assuming their AI isn't good enough to shoot it too.)
What this means is that an infantry force equipped with aimbots would be not only
much more deadly, but also much harder to kill or stop. It would move through the
battleﬁeld like a basilisk, paralyzing and/or destroying anyone who comes within line
of sight. Of course, if both sides have aimbots, the ﬁght would be much more fair.
Aimbots would help enormously against drones. See next section. Aimbots might also
lower the amount of training needed before a recruit becomes better than useless.
Instead of an attachment to an infantry riﬂe, an aimbot could be implemented as a
portable autoturret. It's on a tripod or something, you plop it on the ground and it can
aim and ﬁre automatically, autonomous or remote-controlled. I think this would be
less eﬃcient than the riﬂe implementation but it would have its advantages too. For
example, you could attach them to your vehicles. This already exists and has been
quite eﬀective, see e.g. Trophy.
EDIT: A few months after I posted this, an aimbot was apparently used to assassinate
an Iranian nuclear scientist.
Battle bots

These are machines which propel themselves around the battleﬁeld, identifying and
attacking targets. Early versions are mostly remote-controlled by humans, later
versions are more and more autonomous. There are many varieties, and related
concepts. The core idea is that battle bots are cheaper than human soldiers; for the
price, hassle, and transportation cost of one human soldier you can deliver dozens if
not hundreds or even thousands of battle bots to the ﬁeld. There are other
advantages too. For example, they don't have morale problems, and they always obey
orders. On the other hand, they lack initiative and creativity and lose more of their
eﬀectiveness when communication with command is cut oﬀ. But these disadvantages
will lessen as the technology improves.
Drone swarms are perhaps the most important kind of battle bot. Kamikaze drones ﬂy
into the enemy and explode. Gun drones shoot bullets. Utility drones can transport
cargo, open doors, recharge other drones, drag huge nets through the sky to catch
other drones, scout with bigger cameras and computers, drop bombs, and many more
things, depending on how they are equipped. (All of the above would come as
modules that can be attached or detached easily by a human handler). I'm not sure
whether kamikaze or gun drones would be more prevalent. Currently kamikaze drones
are. (Note: I the previous links I found after writing this. It's nice to see my predictions
conﬁrmed.)
Drone swarms, since they can ﬂy, can close with the enemy very quickly. Since they
are cheap and small, you can have very large swarms and transport them to the
battleﬁeld easily. (You can even just drop them out the back of an airplane!) Say a
drone carrying an explosive charge the size of a grenade costs $10,000 — a
conservative estimate considering that the computer on the drone is probably the
most expensive component, and wouldn't be more than $2,000. Then you can drop
1,000 of them on the battleﬁeld for about the price of a tank (crew not included). Or
200 for the price of a cruise missile. Swarms this big would be very hard to kill. They
are just a bunch of dots in the sky moving very fast and maybe wiggling erratically.
With aimbots you could shoot them down, but even an autoturret would probably only
be able to take out 10 or so before they closed in on it and blew it up. And depending
on how dense the terrain was, maybe that number would be more like 1. So the
swarm would just steamroll over everything in its path until it ran out of battery, or
was stopped by a force of aimbots or battlebots of similar size. (Ordinary human
infantry would be much less eﬀective. Even if you have good aim and good reﬂexes,
you probably won't be able to shoot more than 1 kamikaze drone out of the sky before
the swarm is upon you.) Hiding in buildings or under cars or under camoﬂauge would
be an eﬀective tactic against drone swarms, but not super eﬀective — after all, while
you are hiding you can't contribute to winning the battle, and moreover the drones
can just land like locusts, conserving battery and waiting for targets to come out of
hiding. (This is what makes drone swarms better than artillery barrages or massive
airstrikes. That, and the ability to distinguish friend from foe from civilian. And the
ability to redirect to somewhere else, or even come home, if the enemy turns out to
no longer be in the target location. And the ability to sweep a broad area looking for
enemies.) Moreover, some kinds of drones (quadcopters) might be able to follow you
indoors. See the Slaughterbots video, which has some large kamikaze drones for
taking out doors and windows, and then small kamikaze drones for killing humans. You
could hang beads and cloth in doorways and hallways to impede drone movement,
but utility drones with attachments could get around that.
So far we've been discussing swarms of small drones. But swarms of big drones will
happen too. Air-to-air combat in the age of autonomous vehicles is very much a
numbers thing. How many missiles can you bring to the battle? How many distinct

aircraft do you have, so that the enemy needs to bring at least that many missiles?
How much range do your missiles have? We already have big Predator and Reaper
drones, ﬁtted with various kinds of missiles. Just make loads more of them. In world
war 2 the biggest air raids had thousands of planes. Nowadays we could probably
make at least that many big drones, and probably many more. (Spot check: Predator
costs $4M, so the Pentagon could easily aﬀord to buy 10,000 of them per year, even
without accounting for economies of scale.) "Air raid" will probably be a misnomer;
"Air occupation" more like it. A stormfront of drones smashes into enemy territory,
exchanging missiles with enemy aircraft and anti-air defenses, losing many drones in
the process but not nearly enough. Drones that get low on fuel or ammo go home, and
are replaced by reinforcements. Enemy territory is paralyzed due to constant circling
drones overhead, ready to drop missiles on any suspicious activity.
Minitanks are autoturrets with wheels. Maybe they have some armor too, maybe not.
They are much less mobile than drones, even less mobile than human infantry. Why
build them? Well, if you need lots of auto-aimed guns in a certain location, maybe you
don't have enough human legs to carry them. Or maybe your humans are too
valuable and fragile. Why not just build drones instead? Well, maybe one minitank can
shoot fast enough and is armored enough to be worth 10 drones in most ﬁghts, but
costs only as much as 3. Ground travel is more energy-eﬃcient than air, and it can
aﬀord to have armor. Multiple militaries are already experimenting with these.
Drone submarines are to naval warfare what large drones in the sky are to aerial
warfare. They'll be much smaller and cheaper than ordinary submarines; maybe they
won't even launch torpedos, maybe they'll be kamikazes instead. Swarms of them will
blockade enemy coastlines, ruin enemy trade routes, etc. The US military is already
experimenting with this.
Balloon bombs are a special kind of drone swarm. In World War Two, Japan made
about 10,000 balloons that carried bombs, and sent them up into the jet stream to
drift over the USA and drop their bombs. At the time they didn't have any sort of
ability to aim the bombs or the balloons, so very little damage was done. However,
project Loon has demonstrated that modern technology can steer balloons pretty
much anywhere you want them to go. It just takes a while for them to get there. Once
there, the bombs they drop can be smart bombs, that identify targets using cameras
and GPS and glide right to them. A glide bomb could hit a target within about 70 miles
of the balloon it drops from. They could also carry air-to-air missiles. Balloon bombs
are like large drone swarms, except that they are much much cheaper. It might even
cost more to shoot them down than to make them! If Japan could make 10,000 eighty
years ago with a tiny fraction of their war eﬀort, a modern nation with a bigger
economy could be motivated to make millions.
Drone carriers are to tanks and artillery what aircraft carriers are to battleships. A
drone carrier could be a civilian pickup truck or trailer truck, with crates of drones,
maybe a generator, loads of charging cables and spare batteries, and a few people in
the back. Someone drives, maybe someone else is on their laptop giving commands
to the drones, and the people in the back unpack drones from crates and launch them
on strikes and then grab returning drones out of the air and swap out their batteries.
By military standards civilian trucks are practically free, so a drone carrier is basically
as expensive as the people and drones it carries. And the people need not be highly
skilled. And the drones are cheap. Just as battleships became obsolete, so too will
tanks and maybe even artillery become obsolete. Drone carriers will be just as mobile,
but longer-ranged and hit with more striking power. And they'll be much much
cheaper as well. They'll also be easier to hide since they can pretend to be civilian

trucks and easier to deploy because they aren't as heavy or bulky and also the truck
can potentially be stolen from the local population after you arrive.
Finally, this technically doesn't count as a battle bot because it doesn't ﬁght, but...
currently advanced militaries use a small portion of their soldiers to shoot at the
enemy; most have some sort of job repairing and maintaining vehicles, driving
transport vehicles, loading and unloading things, etc. Many of those jobs could be
automated away by self-driving vehicles or boston-dynamics-style robots, making
military logistics faster and cheaper and freeing up more troops for other tasks. This
would be especially useful if you need to maintain a swarm of thousands of big
drones.
Starships
Starships are vehicles like the SpaceX Starship. Access to space will be very important
in a future war. Being able to view in real-time every inch of their territory, while they
are stuck guessing what is happening in yours, is a humongous advantage. If you can
launch things into space more cheaply than they can, you can destroy their satellites
and put up swarms of your own. Starships will plausibly be at least one order of
magnitude cheaper for delivering stuﬀ into orbit than legacy rockets, possibly two or
more. (Caveat: In space, it is generally easier to destroy than to create. So even if one
nation can put up 10x as many kilograms than another, the other nation might be
able to render space unusable, e.g. by creating a sort of man-made Kessler Syndrome.
However, with Starships it would become so cheap to put things into space that this
diﬃculty might be overcome, e.g. by putting up swarms of armored satellites that can
last half an hour before all being destroyed, but during that time give you the valuable
information you need. I'm not sure about this and would love to see an analysis of the
eﬀectiveness of numbers and/or armor vs. tons of tiny bits of metal polluting LEO)
More excitingly, Starship is supposedly going to be capable of transporting cargo and
humans across large fractions of earth's surface in mere minutes. SpaceX is in talks
with the US military about this; they claim that eventually their costs will be low
enough that a Starship trip will cost about as much as a Globemaster (military cargo
plane) trip. It can carry about as much cargo, but does so much faster and without the
need of a runway on the end. If this is true, it might make cargo planes obsolete, or at
least substantially improve logistical capabilities, especially for nations who don't
have very powerful navies or air forces.
The most interesting (and also most speculative) potential use is for delivering troops
and other payloads into battle. Because the starship would probably not be reusable
after getting shot at, and would not have access to refueling facilities in battle
anyway, this would be an expensive strategy. However, the beneﬁts might be worth it-
-I'll try to make the case for that below.
(You could use Starships that normally serve as cargo ships, thus you still get to
amortize the cost over several ﬂights before you throw them away in the attack. Or,
you could custom-build single-use Starships that use a two-stage design to save all
the expensive bits for reuse.)
A SpaceX Starship can carry 100 tons. 50 tons of drones is plausibly 50,000 drones of
varying sizes. That's enough to paralyze a small city; drones everywhere, blaring on
tinny speakers for everyone to lie on the ground with their hands on their heads. You'd
have 50 tons of cargo space remaining for troops and miscellaneous equipment.

Or, you might use 99 tons to carry extra fuel, so that when you land you could
immediately take oﬀ again, perhaps after having picked up or dropped oﬀ a few very
important passengers. You wouldn't be able to ﬂy all the way home, but maybe you
could ﬂy somewhere safe.
You could strike anywhere in the enemy country, at any time, and they'd only have
twenty minutes of warning at best. So, you could e.g. land at all major power stations
simultaneously, or all major cities, or all major airports. (Seizing airports is especially
important because you can use them to land reinforcements; see the airborne
invasion of Crete) You could land wherever their forces are not, if you have good
enough intel, which you probably would since you have starships. Without actually
attacking, but merely by threatening to, you could force them to keep much of their
military at home, spread out over the country, defending various important
installations. This particular advantage scales with the size of the country you are
ﬁghting; larger nations have higher area-to-perimeter ratios, so forcing them to
defend their whole area rather than just their perimeter is a big deal.
Being able to strike anywhere at any time on very short notice is more valuable than it
sounds. It's easy to underestimate the importance of speed, surprise, and reaction
time in military conﬂict. For example, say a country friendly to you is surprised by a
coup. If you don't act quickly, it will switch over to your enemy's camp. Fortunately,
you can load and fuel a squadron of Starships in a few hours, and then it takes only
twenty minutes to arrive on scene. Or, maybe you are launching a big attack at dawn.
Simultaneously with the attack you can assault the airbases, anti-air facilities, and
transportation hubs behind enemy lines with drone swarms packed into starships. The
drones could potentially be launched while the starship is still high in the sky, making
mission success still possible even if the starship is shot down.
One problem with attack starships is that they might be hard to distinguish from
nukes, and thus might trigger MAD. This problem could potentially be solved by using
them against non-nuclear enemies, or by using them one by one instead of all at
once. (Launch one starship every ﬁfteen minutes; that way if they are secretly nukes
the enemy will still have enough nukes left to massively retaliate; that way they won't
massively retaliate until they see whether they are nukes or not.)
3D printers
I am of the opinion that 3D printers will be a big deal in ten years or so. Currently 3D
printers are expensive to buy, expensive to operate, and the parts they build are
crappy. So they are great for rapid prototyping, but not good for being part of a factory
that makes a ﬁnished product. However, the parts they build are rapidly getting
better--in some ways they are better than any other manufacturing method.
Meanwhile the cost of 3D printers is falling pretty fast. Already I know of some
products (cars, rockets) that have some important 3D-printed parts. As the price falls
and quality improves, more and more parts will be made with 3D printers.
Anyhow, having lots of 3D printers lying around is valuable militarily, I think. Three
reasons. First, military vehicles break down constantly and being able to print
replacement parts is nice. Especially since some vehicles will no longer be in
production so parts will be scarce, and other vehicles may be captured from the
enemy and thus have no spare parts at all.

Second, insurgencies have supply chain problems. They need to buy weapons abroad
and smuggle them in somehow. Being able to print what they need is a game-changer.
Even major nations may have supply chain problems if their enemies have destroyed
your most important factories and supply depots with long-range missiles or airstrikes;
it sure would be nice to have a "virtual factory" consisting of hundreds of thousands of
3D printers distributed throughout your nation.
Third, a future war will involve rapidly changing and evolving technologies and tactics.
World War Two was already like this; the weapons and tactics used at the end of the
war were substantially better than those used in the middle, which were substantially
better than those used at the beginning. 3D printers speed up the design/prototyping
process by, like, an order of magnitude or more. If you have enough of them, they can
also speed up the mass-production process as well; instead of taking three months to
build a factory that produces 1,000 of the new widgets per day, you can command
10,000 of your nation's 3D printers to immediately produce one widget per day each.
Example: Your enemies have countered your drones by putting up nets everywhere.
Response: Design a net-cutter attachment for your drones, and patch their software
so they know how to use it. Thanks to 3D printing you can be testing out 1,000
diﬀerent designs within ﬁve hours of seeing the enemy nets. In a day you have settled
on a design that works, having collected enough data to train/program your drones to
use it. It's a hacky solution, sure, but that's OK since you'll be working on a better
solution soon. By the next morning you've printed a million net-clippers in various
facilities around the country and are already shipping them oﬀ to the front to be
aﬃxed to your drones. Another example: Your eggheads come up with a complex 3D
pattern that works as an adversarial example for the enemy aimbots, when viewed
from a variety of angles and lighting conditions. You print out a bajillion of them and
distribute them to your troops for the next assault, before the enemy realizes the
problem and patches it. And when you ﬁnd a new way to fool their aimbots, your
printers will be ready again.
Laser weapons
Their main application is for defense against incoming drones and missiles (and
balloons?). They are bulky and require a lot of power, but they might still turn out to
be better than the CIWS and other autoturret systems available. They could also
potentially be used as better sniper weapons, since light travels much faster than
bullets. They also can and already are being used as "dazzlers" to temporarily (or, if
you are willing to violate treaties, permanently) blind humans and cameras. However I
am not sure laser technology will ever be good enough to outcompete more mundane
alternatives, and even if they do, they probably won't be that useful compared to
conventional alternatives. I might be wrong though.
Exoskeletons
Exoskeletons are deﬁnitely a thing. Moreover I am fairly conﬁdent that given enough
R&D, a version could be designed that includes enough armor to enable the wearer to
smash through doors and storm an enemy-occupied building, invulnerable to ordinary
bullets. However, by the time this is designed, it will be mostly obsolete, as battle bots
can do the same stuﬀ but better and cheaper and without risking your soldier's life. At
least, so I predict. Perhaps a lighter exoskeleton will be built that goes over the
soldier's legs, and allows him to walk longer and carry heavier loads without getting

tired. Even if this happens, I doubt it will be a game-changer. Similarly, I expect
exoskeletons might see some use for logistical purposes, helping troops load and
unload cargo, or arm and repair aircraft. But not a game-changer, especially since
robots might get good enough to do those tasks as well.

Replicating the replication crisis with
GPT-3?
I am getting worried that people are having so much fun doing interesting stuﬀ with
GPT-3 and AI Dungeon that they're forgetting how easy it is to fool yourself. Maybe we
should think about how many diﬀerent cognitive biases are in play here? Here are
some features that make it particularly easy during casual exploration.
First, it works much like autocomplete, which makes it the most natural thing in the
world to "correct" the transcript to be more interesting. You can undo and retry, or
trim oﬀ extra text if it generates more than you want.
Randomness is turned on by default, so if you try multiple times then you will get
multiple replies and keep going until you get a good one. It would be better science
but less fun to keep the entire distribution rather than stopping at a good one.
Randomness also makes a lot of gamblers' fallacies more likely.
Suppose you don't do that. Then you have to decide whether to share the transcript.
You will probably share the interesting transcripts and not the boring failures, resulting
in a "ﬁle drawer" bias.
And even if you don't do that, "interesting" transcripts will be linked to and upvoted
and reshared, for another kind of survivor bias.
What other biases do you think will be a problem?
