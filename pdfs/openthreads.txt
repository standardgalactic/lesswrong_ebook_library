As well as trying out combining welcome threads and open threads, I thought I'd try
highlighting some frontpage comments I found especially insightful in the last month,
for further discussion:
Scott Garrabrant wrote a comment on how Embedded Agency and Agent
Foundations research are like science in relation to ML approaches to AI
alignment which are more like engineering. The comment helped me think about
how I go about formalising and solving problems more generally.
Rohin Shah wrote a comment on basic deﬁnitions of the alignment problem,
contrasting a motivation-competence split versus a deﬁnition-optimization split.
(It is then followed by a convo on deﬁnitions between Paul and Wei which gets
pretty deep into the weeds - I'd love to read a summary here from anyone else
who followed along.)

Open Thread July 2018
For those low-eﬀort ideas that are worth a little attention but perhaps not a lot (yet).
(shouldn't a bot be posting these?)
Prompts for things to say:
What accomplishments are you celebrating from the last month?
What are you reading?
What subject has taken up most of your thoughts lately?
What is something your fellow rationalists don't understand, but should?

Open thread, February 2018
Apologies if it's already there, but I just can't ﬁnd the open thread.
In case it's not there, open thread for February 2018! Hurray!
In case it is, would it be diﬃcult to check the title string for "open thread" and show a
link to the current month's open thread, ask if that's what the person was looking for,
and still have an option to post if not?

Open Thread - January 2018
Given that the last Open Thread that was intended to be weekly didn't get much
traﬃc, let's try a monthly version.
