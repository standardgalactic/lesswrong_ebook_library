The 2021 Less Wrong Darwin Game
It's fall and that means it's time for another Less Wrong Darwin Game. This year, you'll
be designing up to ten species that will compete for food including (sometimes) eating
each other.
Click here to participate [Entries are now closed.] You have one week from
September 23 to design your species. Submit them by September 30th or earlier.
Each player starts with a population of organisms. Each round each of your organisms
will be randomly paired with another organism. At this point, one of two things will
happen:
If one organism can eat the other organism then it will do so.
If nobody gets eaten then both organisms get an opportunity to forage for plants.
After everyone has eaten, each organism will attempt to reproduce. The more an
organism eats you eat the most descendents an organism can leave.
Food
Each round your organisms lose 20% of their energy to metabolism resulting (on
average) in a 20% decrease in population. You must eat food to counteract
metabolism. There are two sources of food: plants and other animals.
Predation
There are two phases to combat. In the ﬁrst phase organisms size each other up to
ﬁgure out which is the predator and which is prey. There are two ways for an organism
to become the predator.
1. Venom. If one organism has venom but the other does not have antivenom then
the organism with venom is the predator. (Antivenom is a prerequisite to venom.)
2. Weapons. Weapons represent claws, teeth and tusks. If either organism's
weapons value exceeds the prey's weapons + armor then the organism with the
higher weapons value will become the predator.
Venom takes priority over weapons. Once a predator-prey relationship is established (if
a predator-prey relationship is established) the prey will get a chance to escape. If the
prey's speed equals or exceeds the predator's then nobody gets eaten.
Venom, weapons and antivenom all make your organism bigger, which slows down
reproduction.

Omnivores priorize meat over plants, when they can get it even if foraging for plants
would be more metabolically eﬃcient[1].
Predation has an eﬃciency of 0.95[2]. That means 95% of the prey's energy can be
used by the predator.
Only organisms of diﬀerent species eat each other. Cannibalism is disabled.
Foraging for Plants
There are various kinds of plant food available. In order to eat each food you'll need the
proper digestive system.

Whether your organism can digest a particular plant food is a binary value. No
organism is better at digesting leaves than any other organism.
There is a tradeoﬀ. The ability to eat leaves/grass/seeds makes your organism bigger
which slows down reproduction. Also, there is a ﬁnite supply of leaves/grass/seeds. The
more other organisms are foraging from a plant source, the less advantageous it is for
you to forage for it youself.
Simple Ecosystems
Consider an ecosystem with three kinds of plant food available: seeds, leaves and
grass. 1,000 units of each plant food are produced per round.
Example 1
This all may sound a little confusing but it makes sense once we use some real
exampless. Let's start with two species: housecats and mice.

Housecat 1

Mouse

At ﬁrst, both populations grow. The mice reproduce faster than the cats. Then the cats
catch up and eat all of the mice. Having exhausted their food supply, the cat
population starves to extinction.

Example 2
What happens if we add songbirds? Songbirds ﬂy. They are fast enough to evade cats.
But speed costs energy which makes it more expensive for songbirds to breed than for
mice to breed. Mice outcompete songbirds in a world without cats.

We can establish a periodic equilibrium by reintroducing cats. If the mouse population
rises too much the cat population rises to eat them, decreasing the mouse population.

But there is a limit to how high the cat population can get because the cat population is
matched randomly with other organisms and those other organism are often songbirds.
The mouse population is kept in check by the cat population.
The cat population is kept in check by the bird population.
The bird population is kept in check by the mouse population.

Venom
The venomous koalas eat a food source (leaves) disconnected from the rest of the food
chain which relies on seeds. Nothing preys on them because they are venomous and

no other animals have antivenom. They koals are eﬀectively disconnected from the
rest of the ecosystem. They just get in the way of predation by the falcons and the
housecats which helps stabalize the seed-based food web.
Example 4
A world where nothing preys on nor competes with koalas is boring. Let's add owls.
Owls really do prey on koalas.

Introducing owls gets us exciting population spikes and crashes but it wipes out the
mice and housecats.
The problem is owls have too much of an advantage over housecats. Owls and
housecats are almost identical. The only diﬀerence is antivenom, which is cheap.
Koalas are a major food source because only owls prey on them. To give housecats a
chance we need something else to prey on koalas.

The mongeese do keep the owls in check. I'm starting to think housecats might be a
lost cause. Whatever the case, we need a stabalizing animal which thrives when
mongeese are present and declines when there are too many koalas. (This is just the
songbirds we introduced in the beginning except for leaves/koalas/owls instead of
seeds/mice/housecats.)
Giraﬀes eat leaves just like koalas but they are nonvenomous. I gave giraﬀes armor
instead of weapons because if they had weapons they might eat small animals instead
of leaves.

Out new ecosystem has no more diversity than the previous one. (Only six species
survive to equilibrium.) But we have achieved something new. The new ecosystem
sustains a food chain three trophic levels deep. Owls eat snakes eat pandas.

Note that I set the overall plant production lower. This results in smaller populations
which are more likely to be made extinct by random ﬂuctuations. In the grassland,
everything dies but songbirds. Leaves and grass go uneaten. In the rainforest we get a
3-species equilibrium of owls, pandas and mice.
Example 1
Suppose we give each animal a small chance (proportional to its speed) of wandering
to a random biome. Our two biomes are now connected.

This increases biodiversity in ecah particular ecosystem. However, it does not increase
overall biodiversity.

Surviving the environment
The world is a dangerous place. It's not just starvation and other animals that can kill
you. You can only survive in the Ocean/Benthic if you breathe water. You can only

survive on land if you breathe air. Both air and water breathers can survive on the
Rivers and Coasts.
You do not have to manually set whether your organism breathes air or water. This will
be inferred from your spawning location. You cannot start in a river or on a coast.
Temperature
You need heat tolerance to survive in the desert. You need cold tolerance to survive in
the tundra.

The actual game settings
The actual game is more complicated than my examples. There are more biomes and
more plant foods available. I will not be entering my own animals into the game. Only

Questions and Answers
How do I win?
Your species survives.
Can I coordinate with other players?
There is no rule against it.
Can I betray the other players who think I'm
coordinating with them?
There is no rule against it.
I'm worried my species will do poorly and I'll
be publicly shamed.
Use a pseudonym. I will only link to social media if you do well.
How many species can I enter?
Up to 10. I am relying on the honor system. Please do not abuse it.
If multiple participants enter species with the
same name, will you diﬀerentiate the names
so that they can prey on each other?
Yes.
Can I use multiple entry slots to spawn the
same species in multiple biomes?

Sort of. I will diﬀerentiate the names. You will have two separate species with identical
stats but diﬀerent starting conditions.
Do I have to be a Less Wrong user to
participate?
You do not have to be aﬃliated with Less Wrong. Anyone is welcome to participate.
Invite your friends to play!
I found a bug in your code.
Please post a comment or private message me.
Edit: Multicore discovered some major bugs in the code I used for examples. The real
game may be very diﬀerent.
I like your work and would like to support you.
You are under no obligation whatsoever to send donations. My primary objective is to
make a fun, educational game for lots of people.
That said, I do like money. You can Venmo me @Lsusr
What can I win?
Honor and glory. I will link to the winners' social media accounts. (Unless it is
something I consider dangerous or object to on moral grounds.)
Example source code

2021 Darwin Game - Contestants
123 players submitted a total of 556 species. Most players submitted just 1 species.
One player submitted 11. (I disqualiﬁed his[1] 11ᵗʰ submission.) 555 species qualiﬁed
for entry. I expected more players would submit 10 species compared to 8 or 9 in order
to max out their submissions but that didn't happen.
The most popular name was Krill, which three separate people submitted. This does
not count Yellow Krill, Green Krill, Red Krill, Nano-krill, Fornicacious Krill, Orange-Krill
and Orange Krill.

Other duplicate names included Armadillo, Bear, Desert Tortoise, Forest Tribble, Kraken,
Trash Panda and Flesh-Eating Clam.
A couple species were placed in the Tundra/Desert without the necessary temperature
adaptations. I modiﬁed them so they wouldn't instantly die. Other people gave
cold/heat adaptations to water-breathing species, which are useless. I left those
unaltered.

Speaking of useless adaptations, Weapons + Armor is only useful up to 10. If your
Weapons + Armor exceeds 10 the extra armor is useless. 40 submissions (7%) had
Weapons + Armor more than 10. I think the idea here was to create big exciting
powerful monsters. This is the realm of Dragons, Forest Dragons, Basilisks, Sandworms,
White-Whales, Tundrus Rex, Humans, All-eating Leviathans and the so-called "Ultimate
Lifeform". I expect[2] none of them will survive to the end.
I tried to render a food web but it didn't work because there were 54,867 connections. I
let graphviz run for ten hours before putting it out of its misery.
Stats
One sixth of the entries were venomous. One third had antivenom.
Unlike their number of entries, many players did choose to max out weapons, armor
and speed.


Spawning Locations

It makes sense that the ocean is popular because of how much food it supports. I was
surprised by how popular the human garbage dump was. The Desert and Tundra were
the least popular, presumably due to the temperature hazards.
Foraging

The most common foraging adaptations were algae, seeds and carrion.
Algae is on top because there is the most algae.
Seeds were popular because they oﬀers lots of nutrition compared to the
digestive adaptation.
Carrion it is most nutritionally dense option.
Forage or Hunt?
Half of all organisms were pure foragers. Of the rest, the majority had a foraging
adaptation. Only a tiny minority were specialized hunters.

Social Media
I promised link to the winners' social media accounts (if they want). Most went with
Twitter. Some went with LinkedIn, Tumblr, personal websites and Less Wrong itself. Two
picked Instagram.

1. If you didn't submit "Algae Eater Eater" then this isn't you. ↩ 
2. I'm writing these words before running the game. ↩ 

2021 Darwin Game - Tundra
Our Tundra is an inhospitable[1] environment. The only signiﬁcant food available to
herbivores is Lichen, which has a tiny nutritional value of 1. The Tundra is cold too.
Staying warm requires the cold tolerance adaptation, which costs +2 size.

An organism must expend 20% of its energy just to survive. A herbivore foraging for
lichen cannot have a size greater than 5 or else it will expend more energy in
metabolism than it is possible to acquire from eating Lichen.
All organisms have base size 0.1. The cold adaptation (+2) plus the Lichen digestive
tract (+1) costs a total of +3 size. A Tundra herbivore has a minimum size of 3.1. A
herbivore with size 5.1 is untenable since it expends more energy (1.02) than is
possible to obtain from Lichen (1.00).
Players submitted 39 species native to the Tundra. Only 4 of them were viable
herbivores: Micropas, Arctic Slug, Northern Nibbler and "lichen" (not to be confused
with the foragable "Lichen"). (Multicore's Arctic Fox was a carnivore.)
These species could support little in the way of weapons, armor and speed. They were
defenseless. In the ﬁrst 8 turns, all four of our viable foragers are eaten to extinction.

Frostwing Snipper
The Frostwing Snipper

An honorable mention goes to Nem's Frostwing Snipper, a Speed 10 species that could
digest both Lichen and Seeds. The maximum speed made the Frostwing Snipper
immune to predation which let it survive the initial carnage. The ability to digest seeds
meant that the Frostwing Snipper did consume enough energy on average to more
than replace itself.
However, "on average" is not enough. The Tundra's carrying capacity of Frostwing
Snippers was too small. Random ﬂuctuations eventually knocked the Frostwing Snipper
into extinction.

Simon notes that I used 50,000 instead of 1,000 for each species initial energy. Using
the correct value of 1,000 doesn't really change anything except everyone dies faster

To thrive in this game as a forager you must survive the initial predators. One way to do
this is to breed faster than they can eat you. Another way is to use armor or another
defense.
Random guy in NY took a third route. He created the First Round Predator Distractor, a
cheap species with almost zero nutrition and exactly zero chance of survival that kept
the predators in check for a single round.

By Round 100, all that is left are the invincible foragers with maxed-out defense.
However, this time there are two niches: one Flesh-Eating Clam 2, which specializes in
carrion, and another for Super-Armor Fish, which eats algae too.
Generations 101-9000
Alas, the Super-Armor Fish's ability to digest Algae lets it eventually outcompete the
Flesh-Eating Clam2. A Soonbegon wanders in from time to time from to eat the
accumulated Detritus.
Winners
Technically the Soonbegon doesn't survive forever (it goes extinct sometime before
generation 10,000) but it survived long enough and interestingly enough I'm going to
bend the rules and give it credit anyway.

As you might guess, the Barnicle is an invincible Detritus eater and the Deepwater
Devourer is a carnivore. However, the Deepwater Devourer is not an apex predator. It
has only 3 Attack and 6 speed. (It also has Antivenom and the ability to consume
Detritus.)

In each of our previous biomes, there was one primary source of forage. This is our ﬁrst
biome with many diﬀerent viable options to forage. However, individually, none of
them are very large. Even if there's no predators, the diverse primary production
should ensure a little more biodiversity among foragers.

The Seed Beetle Population explodes. I think what's going on is something Multicore
pointed out at the game launch. The Seed Beetle is so small that it provides
inadequate nutrition to large carnivores. At ﬁrst, predators eat the Seed Beetle, then
the carnivores starve. The Seed Beetle is thus left without predators.
The Mutant Two-Headed Speed Snail is a Grass forager with Speed 2. The Beauprey

We have four invincible foragers: Nuclear Waste consumes Carrion. Trash Slime
consumes Detritus. Snarks consume Leaves. Hopsplitters consume Grass and Seeds.
The Forest Finch competes for leaves with the Snark.
The Hopsplitters compete for seeds with the Seed Beetles and the Beaupreys. The
Seed Beetle is a tiny organism optimized to consume seeds. The Beauprey is less
eﬃceint at eating seeds than the Seed Beetle but makes up for it by also being able to
digest Lichen.
The Mutant Two-Headed Speed Snail eats grass, where it competes with the
Hopsplitter.
The Brown Bear is a pure predator. It cannot eat the invincible foragers but it can eat
the Seed Beetles, Snails, Hopsplitters, Forest Finghes and Forest Finches.
Putting this all together, we have two kinds of foragers: small foragers that can be
eaten by bears and invincible foragers those that cannot. If the bear population
increases the small forager population decreases which increases the invincible forager
population which decreases the bear population. This cycle works in reverse too. We
have a stable ecosystem.
But if it's stable then what happened around generation 690?
The Seed Beetle population decreased because the Beauprey population increased.
The Beauprey Population increased because there was lots of Lichen available. The
Beauprey is the only species which can eat Lichen. Around generations 550 to 650
there were very few Beaupreys. The Lichen accumulated. The Beauprey's growth
around population 680 ate that accumulated Lichen. After the Lichen was consumed,
the Beauprey population decreased to something stable.
Generations 1000-9000
The dynamic equilibrium is maintained until generation 8101 when the Beaupreys
suddenly go extinct.

Goes Extinct in Generation Species
8101
Beauprey
Let's zoom in.
What happened is the Brown Bear population randomly rose for long enough to
extinguish the Beaupreys, which were already in a precarious position due to
competition from the Seed Beetles..
But that's not all. I just counted the common species. There are a few rare species
hiding on the bottom edge of our graph, like Snarks. The Snark is a 10-speed Leaf eater
by Vanessa. The Beauprey, having Speed 1, comes back from time to time too.

2021 Darwin Game - River
The River contains lots of every foragable food. The River is like the Human Garbage Dump except:
1. It has 5x as many resources.
2. Both air-breathing and water-breathing species can survive in the River.
3. Organisms may not start in the River. They must wander in.

The same pattern repeats for each foragable. First the foragable accomulates. Then a species which
can consume the foragable appears. Its population explodes until it has eaten the accumulated
foragable. Finally, its population reverts to carrying capacity.
Persephone 0461's Very Lesser Forest Dragon wandered in. It thrived until another predator appeared
which hunted it to extinction.

2021 Darwin Game - Everywhere Else
Shore
The Shore is an inhospitable wasteland. Algae is available, but it's not very nitrutious. Coconuts oﬀer an even
worse calories-to-digestion ratio.

No coconut eaters got established in the Human Garbage Dump, which means no coconut eaters got
established in the River or Shore instead. The only available food is algae. The Shore is basically a small bit of
Ocean biome with ⅒ of the algae. The algae-eating winner of our Ocean competition has zero speed so it
cannot migrate to the Shore.
To top all of it oﬀ, predators migrate in from both sea and land.

Soonbegons migrate from time to time to eat the Detritus. Otherwise, the Shore is mostly a graveyard.
